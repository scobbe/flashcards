# Chinese Flashcard Generation Rules

## TITLE

Chinese Flashcard Generation Rules

## CONTRACT

You must do all of the following. If any single item cannot be satisfied, output exactly:

```
BLOCKED
<why: bullet list of missing Wiktionary fields by card and by label, with the exact page URL for each attempted lookup>
```

Do not output any cards when blocked.

## SCOPE

You will receive unstructured Chinese learning text. You must extract vocabulary items that have an exact Wiktionary entry and generate flashcards using only Wiktionary. No other sources. No abbreviations anywhere. No commentary. No previews. Exception: For multi-character words (two or more characters), the Etymology subfields may be filled using the model's general knowledge; include the Wiktionary page as the Reference when available.

## FORMAT LOCK

For each card, emit exactly this shape, with the same labels and order, no extra lines, no code fences.

Line 1:  ## <front text>
Line 1a for component cards at any recursion depth: the front must be exactly two lines — `## <ENGLISH SENSE OF COMPONENT>` on the first line, and `### component of "<PARENT ENGLISH>"` on the second line. This rule applies recursively for every component inside any parent.
Line 1b for subword cards inside multi-character words: the front must be exactly two lines — `## <ENGLISH SENSE OF SUBWORD>` then `### subword in "<PARENT ENGLISH>"`.
Line 1c for first character-layer cards under a multi-character word: the front must be exactly two lines — `## <ENGLISH SENSE OF CHARACTER>` then `### subword in "<PARENT ENGLISH>"`.
Line 2:  ---
Then the following labeled bullets in order, each on its own line:

- **Character:** <text>
- **Pronunciation:** <pinyin with tone marks>
- **Definition:** <definition from Wiktionary for this sense>
- **Contemporary usage:**

  - <example 1 in the form "characters (pinyin) - english translation">
  - <example 2>   (write "None" if Wiktionary has no examples)
- **Etymology:**

  - **Type:** <single characters/components: as named on Wiktionary; multi-character words: may be supplied from general knowledge>
  - **Description:** <single characters/components: composition details from Wiktionary only; multi-character words: concise formation summary from general knowledge>
  - **Interpretation:** <short paraphrase; may use general knowledge for multi-character words>
  - **Reference:** <single Wiktionary link to the exact page for this card>
  - **Simplification explanation:** optional; include only when a simplified form exists. Be concise and name the transformation (e.g., radical reduction 釒→钅, component omission 貝→贝) and why it preserves meaning.
  Labeling rule: If the headword is simplified and the page lists a traditional form, write the label as `- **Etymology (TRAD):**` where TRAD is the traditional headword. Otherwise use `- **Etymology:**`.
    Line N:  %%%

## RECURSION HARD SPEC

This section is binding and exhaustive.

1. Top level

* For any multi character word, create the top level word card first.

2. Character layer

* Then create a card for each constituent character that appears in the top level word spelling on its Wiktionary page for Chinese.
* Use the front format from Line 1c for the first character layer (two lines: `## <ENGLISH SENSE>` and `### subword in "<parent English>"`). The parent name is the immediate container term in English. For deeper graphemic components, use Line 1a (two lines: `## <ENGLISH SENSE>` and `### component of "<parent English>"`).
* Never use the phrase "component in" for any card. Use `— component of` only for graphemic components and `— subword in` only for lexical subwords inside multi-character words.

3. Composition driven decomposition

* For each character card, open its exact Wiktionary page and read the Chinese Etymology section.
* If and only if Wiktionary explicitly states a phono semantic compound or ideogrammic compound or another composition that names components, you must create one card per named component.
* Each such component card must again use the Line 1a front with its parent set to the character you just decomposed.

4. Depth and stop conditions

* Continue decomposition until you reach items that have no further composition stated in the Chinese Etymology section on their own exact page.
* Stop when the page gives no components or gives a description that does not name further components.
* Radicals, pictograms, or forms that lack a component list are stops.

5. Multiple etymologies and variant forms

* If a character page has multiple Chinese etymologies numbered, choose the etymology that matches the sense used in the immediate parent if Wiktionary makes that mapping explicit. If not explicit, use Etymology 1.
* If the page lists traditional and simplified forms, use the form that matches the spelling of the immediate parent term. Record mapping inside the **Description** only if present on that exact page.

6. Ordering and duplicates

* Preserve the component order as listed on Wiktionary for that etymology.
* If a component repeats, you must still create one card for that component. Do not create duplicates for repeated mentions at the same depth.

7. Evidence and failures

* If composition type or component names are missing on the character page, you must not invent them. Mark **Type** as `unspecified`, leave **Description** and **Interpretation** as specified by the rules, and stop decomposition for that path.
* If any required field for any card at any depth is missing and cannot be satisfied under these rules, output BLOCKED with the per card missing fields and exact page URLs. Do not emit any partial cards.

## SOURCES

Every fact must come from the exact English Wiktionary page for that term, Chinese section only. If a fact is missing on that page, write the literal phrase `unspecified` and continue, unless the CONTRACT requires BLOCKED. Never switch sources. Links must be to en.wiktionary.org with no query strings.

Exception: For multi-character words (two or more characters), the **Etymology** subfields (**Type**, **Description**, **Interpretation**) do not need to be sourced from Wiktionary and may be filled using the model's general knowledge. Still include a single **Reference** link to the term’s Wiktionary page when available. The **Reference** anchor text must be `[<HEADWORD> — Wiktionary]` and the URL must be `https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/<slug>` with no query strings.

## PREVENT MODEL DRIFT

Do not add fields. Do not change label names. Do not reorder any bullets. Do not wrap anything in code fences. Do not summarize or explain outside the cards. No abbreviations anywhere.

## PREFLIGHT CHECKLIST  run silently

1. Confirm each item has a real en.wiktionary.org page URL for the exact lemma.
2. Confirm pinyin exists. Convert tone numbers to tone marks if necessary.
3. Confirm an etymology type exists. For single characters/components, use Wiktionary or mark `unspecified`. For multi-character words, you may supply the type from general knowledge or mark `unspecified`.
4. Confirm zero or more Chinese examples exist and extract them. If none, write `None`.
5. Confirm any traditional and simplified mapping if present on that exact page and include only what is present.
6. For recursion, confirm composition type and component names for each character before creating component cards.

## EVIDENCE MODE  mandatory internal buffer

Before generating any card, you must extract and store verbatim evidence from the exact page for these items:

* Pronunciation pinyin for Chinese
* Sense definition text for the used sense
* Each Chinese example line used (word/phrase/sentence)
* Etymology Type (single characters/components only)
* Etymology Description and named components list (single characters/components only)
  For multi-character words, Etymology fields are exempt from Wiktionary evidence and may be filled from general knowledge. If any required item above is absent on the page, record `MISSING` for that field for that card.
For pronunciation, record exactly the pinyin string(s) as printed on the page (convert tone numbers to tone marks where needed). Neutral tone has no mark; multiple readings are separated with ` / `.

## VERIFICATION GATE

* If any required evidence item is `MISSING` for any selected card (excluding multi-character words' Etymology fields), output BLOCKED with the per card missing fields and the exact page URL. Do not emit any cards.
* If all required evidence exists, proceed to output cards. All output must be drawn from the evidence buffer. No free writing.

## POSTFLIGHT VALIDATOR  run silently

1. Every card has exactly one divider line made of three hyphens.
2. Every card ends with exactly one line containing three percent signs.
3. Labels appear in the exact order specified in FORMAT LOCK.
4. No abbreviations appear anywhere.
5. All references are confined to the single **Reference** field.
6. Pinyin has tone marks.
7. All component cards use the Line 1a front format with the correct parent.
8. Recursion stops only where Wiktionary lacks named components.
9. All bullets use `-` and nested bullets are indented by exactly two spaces.
10. The Etymology subfields appear in exactly this order and depth: Type, Description, Interpretation, Reference, Simplification explanation (optional).
11. The **Reference** anchor text is `[<HEADWORD> — Wiktionary]` and the URL is `https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/<slug>` with no query strings.
12. No parentheses appear in the **Pronunciation** field; neutral tone has no mark; multiple readings are separated by ` / `.
13. Fronts use exactly two lines: Line 1c (first character layer) uses `## <ENGLISH SENSE>` then `### subword in "<parent English>"`; Line 1a (deeper graphemic components) uses `## <ENGLISH SENSE>` then `### component of "<parent English>"`; Line 1b (lexical subwords) uses `## <ENGLISH SENSE>` then `### subword in "<parent English>"`. The phrase `component in` is disallowed anywhere. No CJK characters may appear in any front line.
14. The front parent must be an English word wrapped in double quotes on the second header line.
15. The **Character** field contains the Chinese headword; it may optionally include a cross-script form in parentheses (e.g., 银 (銀)); otherwise no parentheses.
16. The **Reference** anchor `<HEADWORD>` must equal the primary headword (the portion before any parentheses).
17. Under **Contemporary usage**, either exactly two sub-bullets are present in the required shape or a single standalone line `None` appears with no sub-bullets.
18. If a Simplification explanation is present, either the **Character** field includes a parenthetical cross-script form or the **Etymology** label is of the `Etymology (TRAD):` form.

## INTERACTIVE WORKFLOW

Step 0  Ask the user for input (unstructured Chinese learning text).
Step 1  Parse the user's input.
Step 2  Output only the proposed list of top-level vocabulary items (multi-character words and standalone headwords) extracted from the input. Do not include constituent characters or components; those will be added automatically during recursion after confirmation.
Step 3  Wait for user confirmation of the list.
Step 4  Evidence Checklist. For each confirmed term, print a checklist that shows for each field whether EVIDENCE is QUOTED or MISSING and include the single page URL. No card content in this step. Wait for approval.
Step 5  Wait for user confirmation to proceed.
Step 6  Generate the selected card set as a single Markdown document (.md), with no code fences, suitable for import.

## FAILURE MODE

If any preflight or verification gate item fails for any card, emit BLOCKED with the per card missing fields and the exact Wiktionary URLs you attempted. Do not include any partial cards.

## STYLE

No abbreviations anywhere. Use tone marks for pinyin. Use the exact literal phrases specified above when data is missing.

Etymology description detail level:
- Default: include only composition roles and component names in a compact pattern (e.g., `semantic: X + phonetic: Y`).
- Additional historical or glyph-origin context is allowed only when the page presents multiple interpretations or the composition is ambiguous on that page; otherwise omit commentary.

Archaic front marker:
- If Contemporary usage provides fewer than two valid examples (i.e., at least one `None`), append ` (archaic)` to the front’s English sense on the `##` line.
