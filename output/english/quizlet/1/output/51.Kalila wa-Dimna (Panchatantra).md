## Kalila wa-Dimna (Panchatantra)
---
- **definition:**
  - the classical Arabic collection of animal fables (by Ibn al‑Muqaffaʿ) derived from the Indian Panchatantra; titled for the jackals Kalila and Dimna
  - the Sanskrit source work, Panchatantra, a set of interlinked animal tales teaching practical wisdom and statecraft
- **etymology:**
  - kalila wa-dimna is Arabic for “Kalila and Dimna” (wa = “and”); the names came via Middle Persian Kalīlag ud Damnag from Sanskrit character names Karataka and Damanaka
  - panchatantra is Sanskrit: pancha “five” + tantra “treatise, framework,” literally “five treatises”
  - the title’s pathway is linguistic: Sanskrit > Middle Persian > Arabic, yielding the widely known Arabic name
- **history:**
  - the Panchatantra likely took shape in India between about 200 BCE and 300 CE, traditionally ascribed to Vishnu Sharma for instructing princes
  - a Middle Persian (Pahlavi) version was made by the physician Burzōy/Burzūya under Sasanian king Khosrow I (r. 531–579), now lost but influential
  - around 750 CE Ibn al‑Muqaffaʿ adapted it into Arabic as Kalila wa-Dimna in early Abbasid Iraq; it later spread via a 12th‑century Hebrew version and John of Capua’s Latin Directorium vitae humanae (c. 1278), shaping European fable tradition
