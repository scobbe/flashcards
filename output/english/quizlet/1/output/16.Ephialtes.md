- **etymology:**
  - from ancient Greek Ephialtēs (Ἐφιάλτης), built from epi- “upon” + hallomai “to leap,” literally “leaper-upon”
  - in later Greek, ephialtēs also meant “nightmare” or an incubus that presses on sleepers; the personal name shares this form
  - entered English via Latinized/classical sources, retaining the -ēs ending in spelling and an -eez sound in pronunciation

  - c. 462–461 bce: Ephialtes of Athens stripped the Areopagus of key powers; he was assassinated soon after, paving the way for Periclean democracy
