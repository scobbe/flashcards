## The lady doth protest too much, methinks
---
- **definition:**
  - said when someone denies something so strongly or so often that it seems insincere
  - used ironically to suggest the opposite is true—hinting at hidden guilt, desire, or embarrassment
- **etymology:**
  - from Early Modern English, a Shakespearean phrasing; doth is the archaic third-person singular of do (from Old English dōþ)
  - protest comes via French and Latin (Latin protestari, “declare publicly, affirm”), originally meaning “to avow” rather than “to object”
  - lady traces to Old English hlæfdige (“bread-kneader; mistress of a household”); too much is a native English intensifier phrase
- **history:**
  - first appears in English in Shakespeare’s Hamlet (act 3, scene 2), performed c. 1600–1601 and printed in the early 1600s
  - in the scene, Gertrude reacts to the Player Queen’s extreme vows; at the time protest meant “solemnly declare,” so the line critiques over-vowing
  - by the 19th–20th centuries the quotation had become an idiom meaning “deny too emphatically,” often shortened to protest too much in journalism and everyday speech
- **pronunciation:**
  - thuh LAY-dee duth pro-TEST too MUCH

---
- **definition:**
  - a dissolute, immoral man who pursues pleasure recklessly, especially in sex and drink (rake)

- **etymology:**
  - derived from rakehell (16th c.), an English compound literally meaning “hell‑raker”; clipped to rake in the 17th century
  - rakehell was likely influenced by Middle English rakel “rash, headstrong” (compare reckless), reinforcing the sense of wild behavior
  - rakish formed with the suffix -ish from rake (libertine) in the late 17th century; its appearance-based sense broadened from the image of fashionable rakes
- **history:**
  - first attested as rakehell in the 1540s; the shortened rake became prominent in Restoration England (c. 1660–1700), amid a culture of aristocratic libertinism
  - restoration comedies and figures like John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, popularized the type; Hogarth’s A Rake's Progress (1732–34) satirized the rake’s downfall
  - by the 18th–19th centuries, rakish shifted from moral judgment to style, coming to mean “dashing” or “fashionably disreputable,” applied to hats, ships, and later cars

- **history:**
