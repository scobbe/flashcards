## North Germanic languages
---
- **definition:**
  - the northern branch of the Germanic language family, including Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, Icelandic, and Faroese
  - the group of related tongues descended from Old Norse, often called the Scandinavian languages
- **etymology:**
  - formed in English from north (Old English norð, “north”) + Germanic (from Latin Germanicus, “of the Germani”) + languages
  - Germanic goes back to Latin Germani (name for tribes east of the Rhine); languages comes via Old French langage from Latin lingua, “tongue, language”
- **history:**
  - first used in English scholarship in the 19th century during the rise of comparative philology (notably Rasmus Rask and Jacob Grimm)
  - descends from Old Norse (c. 8th–14th centuries), which split into West Norse (Icelandic, Norwegian, Faroese) and East Norse (Danish, Swedish) during and after the Viking Age (c. 800–1100)
  - in the 19th–20th centuries, national standardizations boosted mutual intelligibility among mainland varieties, while Icelandic stayed conservative and Faroese gained a standard orthography
