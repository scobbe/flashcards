  - the derivative Salishan was later formed in English by adding -an to label the broader language family

  - late 19th–20th centuries: scholars (notably Franz Boas and colleagues) popularized the term for a cultural-linguistic area, distinguishing Coast Salish and Interior Salish
  - 1988–2009: the geographic name Salish Sea was proposed (1988) and officially adopted by the U.S. and Canada (2009), reflecting recognition of Coast Salish homelands and shared waters
