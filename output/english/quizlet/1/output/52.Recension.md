## Recension
---
- **definition:**
  - a critically revised version of a text, prepared by comparing and evaluating different manuscripts or sources
  - the act or process of producing such a critically established version
- **etymology:**
  - from Latin recensio “review, examination,” from recensere “to review, enumerate” (re- “again” + censere “to assess, judge”); adopted into English via scholarly Latin in the 17th century
  - shares the root censere with words like census and censure; the -sion ending comes from Latin -sio, forming nouns of action
- **history:**
  - first recorded in English in the mid-17th century (1650s), as scholars and presses intensified work on critical editions of classical and biblical texts
  - in the 18th–19th centuries it became central in textual criticism (e.g., Lachmann’s methods in the 1830s), labeling distinct edited versions or manuscript families
  - 20th-century usage broadened slightly to fields like folklore and myth to mean a distinct version of a narrative, though it remains chiefly an academic term
- **pronunciation:**
  - rih-SEN-shun
