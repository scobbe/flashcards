## Ayyubid dynasty
---
- **definition:**
  - a medieval Sunni Muslim ruling family of Kurdish origin that governed Egypt, Syria, and nearby regions, founded by Saladin
  - the period of their rule (c. 1171–1260) in those lands
- **etymology:**
  - from Arabic Ayyūbī “of Ayyūb,” built on Ayyūb, the ancestor’s name; English uses the -id form for dynasties
  - Ayyūb is the Arabic form of Job (Hebrew Iyov), so “Ayyubid” means “of/descended from Ayyub”
  - dynasty comes from Greek dynasteia “lordship, rule,” via Latin and French
- **history:**
  - founded in 1171 when Saladin ended the Fatimid caliphate in Egypt and established his rule
  - reached a high point in 1187 by taking Jerusalem after Hattin; then confronted the Third Crusade (1189–1192)
  - split among Saladin’s heirs; replaced in Egypt by the Mamluks in 1250 and eclipsed in Syria by 1260 amid Mongol invasions
- **pronunciation:**
  - eye-YOO-bid DY-nuh-stee
