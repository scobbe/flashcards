## Septum piercing
---
- **definition:**
  - a body piercing placed through the nasal septum, the tissue between the nostrils
  - the jewelry worn in that location (such as a ring or circular barbell)
- **etymology:**
  - compound of septum + piercing, modeled on other body‑piercing terms
  - septum from Latin saeptum meaning "enclosure, partition," used in anatomy for a dividing wall
  - piercing from English pierce via Old French percer, ultimately from Latin pertundere meaning "to thrust through"; the noun formed with the -ing suffix
- **history:**
  - practiced in many cultures long before modern fashion (e.g., Aztec and Maya elites; Asmat and other New Guinea groups; some Indigenous North American peoples); the French label "Nez Perce" ("pierced nose") in the 18th–19th centuries referred to septum piercing
  - in Western subcultures it grew with the body-piercing movement of the 1970s–1980s (Jim Ward’s Gauntlet, 1975; punk aesthetics), and the phrase "septum piercing" entered common English by the late 20th century
  - in the 2000s–2010s it became mainstream through celebrity influence and social media, expanding jewelry styles and reducing stigma
- **pronunciation:**
  - SEP-tum PEER-sing
