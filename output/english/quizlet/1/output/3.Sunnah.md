## Sunnah
---
- **definition:**
  - the Prophet Muhammad’s teachings, actions, and approvals, taken as a model and a primary source for Islamic law and ethics
  - more generally, a customary practice or established way; in Islamic law, a recommended (not obligatory) act
- **etymology:**
  - from Arabic sunnah ‘custom, practice; established way,’ from the root s-n-n meaning ‘to lay down (a rule), make smooth, sharpen,’ giving the sense ‘set course’
  - borrowed into English from Arabic (also seen as sunna or sunnat), often capitalized when referring to the Prophet’s tradition
  - related to Arabic ahl al-sunna ‘people of the tradition,’ the source of the term Sunni
- **history:**
  - in pre-Islamic Arabia, sunnah meant customary practice; by the 7th–8th centuries CE it came to denote the Prophet’s normative example
  - the concept was systematized with major hadith compilations in the 9th century (e.g., al-Bukhari, d. 870; Muslim, d. 875), shaping law, ritual, and ethics
  - entered English scholarly usage in the 19th century via Orientalist studies; modern usage contrasts Sunnah with bid‘ah (innovation) and also labels non-obligatory acts as sunnah
- **pronunciation:**
  - SOON-nuh
