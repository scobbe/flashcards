## Creole language
---
- **definition:**
  - a natural language that develops from the mixing of different languages and becomes the native tongue of a community
  - a former pidgin that expands in grammar and vocabulary to serve all everyday needs
- **etymology:**
  - from french créole “person native to a colony,” via spanish criollo and portuguese crioulo meaning “native to the colony”
  - portuguese crioulo is a diminutive of criar “to raise, bring up,” from latin creare “to create, bring forth”
  - the compound “creole language” applies the ethnonym to the community’s speech to distinguish it from the European colonial language
- **history:**
  - 17th–19th centuries: colonial expansion and the Atlantic slave trade created contact settings where pidgins formed and some nativized into creole languages (e.g., Haitian Creole by the late 1700s)
  - english “creole” appears in the 1600s; by the late 1700s–early 1800s, travelers and administrators referred to local vernaculars as “Creole”; Hugo Schuchardt pioneered academic study in the late 1800s
  - mid–late 20th century, linguists such as Robert A. Hall Jr. and Derek Bickerton emphasized creoles as full languages; official recognition followed (Seychelles Creole 1981; Haitian Creole 1987)
