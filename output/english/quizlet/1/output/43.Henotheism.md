  - a tendency in polytheistic traditions to elevate one deity as supreme above the rest

  - from Greek hen- (from heis/henos, “one”) + theos (“god”) + -ism (“belief or practice”), literally “one-god-ism”
  - coined in English in the 19th century by Max Müller, modeled on Greek-based terms like monotheism and polytheism
- **history:**
  - first appeared in English in the 1860s, coined by Max Müller (1823–1900) in studies of the Rig Veda to label hymns that exalt one god at a time
  - late 19th–early 20th century scholars used it in comparative religion to map positions between polytheism and monotheism
  - in the 20th century it was applied to ancient Israel and Near Eastern contexts (e.g., devotion to Marduk or Zeus) to describe phases before strict monotheism
