---
- **definition:**

  - a beaklike projection, especially the bill of a bird or the snout/mouthpart of an animal
  - the beak or battering prow of an ancient warship
- **etymology:**
  - from Latin rostrum meaning "beak, bill" and "ship's ram"; an instrument noun formed with -trum from rodere "to gnaw," literally "gnawing tool"
  - the public-speaking sense comes via Latin rostra (plural of rostrum), the speakers' platform named for the ship prows affixed to it; English later used the singular rostrum for such a platform
- **history:**
  - in ancient Rome (338 BCE), the Forum's speakers' platform—Rostra—was adorned with prows from captured ships after the victory at Antium; it became a focal site of oratory where figures like Cicero spoke
  - in English, rostrum is attested from the 1540s for "beak/prow"; the "speaking platform" sense entered by 1766 amid neoclassical interest in Rome and soon was common in politics and auctions
  - by the 17th–19th centuries, scientists extended the term to various beaklike anatomical structures in zoology and botany, cementing its technical use in biology
- **pronunciation:**
  - ROSS-trum
