## Skeuomorph
---
- **definition:**
  - a design feature that copies the look of an older material or method even when it no longer serves a function
  - in digital design, a visual element that imitates a real-world object to make software feel familiar (like a trash can icon)
- **etymology:**
  - from Greek skeuos “vessel, implement” + morphē “form, shape,” literally “tool-form” or “vessel-shape”
  - coined in English as a learned compound in the late 19th century, using the combining form -morph from Greek morphē
- **history:**
  - first attested in 1889 in archaeology by H. Colley March, describing decorative survivals that imitate earlier construction (e.g., clay mimicking wood joinery)
  - through the 20th century, used in design history to explain how new materials kept familiar looks during industrialization
  - revived in tech discourse in the 2000s–2010s for user interfaces (notably Apple’s leather and felt textures); by 2013, the shift to “flat design” (e.g., iOS 7) marked a backlash against skeuomorphism
- **pronunciation:**
  - SKYOO-uh-morf
