---
- **definition:**
  - to make the movement and sound of vomiting; to gag or heave, sometimes without bringing anything up
  - to vomit
- **etymology:**
  - from Old English hræccan “to cough up, clear the throat; hawk,” literally “to eject phlegm”
  - related to other Germanic words for spitting (compare Old Norse hrækja “to spit”), from a Germanic root meaning “to spit/bring up”
  - the modern -tch spelling developed from the Old English -cc sound; not related to wretch (from Old English wrecca “exile”)
- **history:**
  - first attested in Old English (before 1100) describing clearing the throat and spitting, common in everyday and medical contexts
  - during Middle English (c. 1200–1500) the sense shifted toward gagging and vomiting; by the 16th century it commonly referred to dry heaving
  - in modern use it marks visceral disgust in narratives, while clinical usage distinguishes retching (heaving) from actual vomiting
