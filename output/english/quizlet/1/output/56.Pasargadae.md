## Pasargadae
---
- **definition:**
  - ancient city and archaeological site in southwestern Iran, the first capital of the Achaemenid Empire founded by Cyrus the Great
  - in classical sources, also the name of a Persian tribe associated with the region
- **etymology:**
  - from Latin Pasargadae, via Greek Pasargádai (Πασαργάδαι), a plural form used in classical texts
  - often traced to Old Persian elements Pārsa (“Persian”) + -gādā/-gadha (“place, settlement”), yielding “place/encampment of the Persians”; exact formation is uncertain
  - the Greek plural may reflect a tribal name (“the Pasargadae”), with the city name deriving from that ethnonym
- **history:**
  - founded by Cyrus the Great in the mid-6th century BCE (c. 546–530 BCE) as the inaugural Achaemenid capital; notable for palaces, gardens, and the Tomb of Cyrus
  - largely eclipsed by Persepolis under Darius I (late 6th–5th c. BCE); respected and reportedly restored by Alexander the Great in the 330s BCE
  - attested in English by the early modern period through translations of Greek and Latin histories; systematically excavated in the 20th century (e.g., Ernst Herzfeld, Ali Sami) and inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2004
