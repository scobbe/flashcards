## Samaritan Judaism
---
- **definition:**
  - the religion of the Samaritan community, based on the Torah and centered on worship at Mount Gerizim
  - a distinct tradition related to ancient Israelite religion, separate from rabbinic Judaism
- **etymology:**
  - “Samaritan” via Latin Samaritanus and Greek Samareitēs “person from Samaria,” from Hebrew Shomron “Samaria” (named after Shemer; later linked to shamar “to watch/guard”)
  - “Judaism” from Latin Iudaismus via Greek Ioudaismos “the religion/way of the Judeans,” from Ioudaios “Judean,” ultimately from Hebrew Yehudah “Judah”
  - the English compound combines these to denote the Samaritan form of the Judean/Israelite religion
- **history:**
  - emerged as a distinct stream by the Persian period (5th–4th c. BCE), with a temple on Mount Gerizim; that sanctuary was destroyed by John Hyrcanus c. 111–110 BCE
  - persisted through Roman and Byzantine eras; Samaritan revolts in 484, 529, and 555 CE brought harsh repression and steep decline, yet the Samaritan Pentateuch and rites endured
  - the English label appears in modern scholarship by the late 19th–20th centuries; today about 800–900 Samaritans live mainly in Nablus and Holon, keeping practices like Passover sacrifices on Gerizim
- **pronunciation:**
  - suh-MARE-uh-tuhn JOO-dee-iz-um
