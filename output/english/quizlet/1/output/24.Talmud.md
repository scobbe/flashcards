## Talmud
---
- **definition:**
  - the central text of Rabbinic Judaism, comprising the Mishnah and Gemara, guiding Jewish law, ethics, and tradition
  - either of its two compilations (Babylonian or Jerusalem), especially the more widely studied Babylonian Talmud
- **etymology:**
  - from Medieval Latin Talmud (and French Talmud), ultimately from Hebrew talmūd, literally “study” or “teaching”
  - formed from the Hebrew root l‑m‑d (lamad), meaning “to learn/teach,” yielding a noun meaning “instruction/learning”
- **history:**
  - compiled c. 3rd–6th centuries CE: the Jerusalem Talmud (c. 4th–5th) in Roman/Byzantine Palestine and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 5th–6th) in Sasanian Babylonia, the latter becoming authoritative
  - targeted at times by authorities: manuscripts burned after the Disputation of Paris (1242) and large-scale church burnings in Rome and Italy (1553), even as study persisted
  - attested in English by the early 17th century in scholarly and polemical writings; today used in academic and religious contexts for the rabbinic canon
- **pronunciation:**
