## Monolatry
---
- **definition:**
  - exclusive worship of one god while accepting that other gods exist
  - the practice or doctrine of devoting worship to a single deity among many
- **etymology:**
  - from Greek monos “alone, single” + Greek latreia “service, worship,” literally “single-worship”
  - built in English from the combining forms mono- + -latry, the latter via French/Latin from Greek latreia
- **history:**
  - attested in English by the mid-19th century, as comparative religion developed precise labels for belief systems
  - used by late-19th-century biblical scholars (e.g., Julius Wellhausen) to characterize early Israelite religion before strict monotheism
  - applied to some ancient contexts—such as parts of the Iron Age Levant (c. 1200–600 BCE) and debates over Akhenaten’s Aten cult (14th c. BCE)—with usage refined through the 20th century
- **pronunciation:**
  - muh-NOL-uh-tree
