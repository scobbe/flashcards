- **definition:**

  - a commentary or book that explains Qur'anic verses using language, context, and tradition
- **etymology:**
  - from Arabic tafsir (tafsīr), a verbal noun meaning "explanation" or "exegesis"
  - formed from the verb fassara "to explain, interpret," based on the triliteral root F-S-R meaning "to make clear"
  - borrowed into English as an unchanged Arabic loanword used in scholarly contexts
- **history:**
  - early Islamic exegesis took shape in the 7th–8th centuries as companions and successors interpreted verses and collected reports
  - the discipline matured in the 9th–14th centuries with major works by al-Tabari (d. 923), al-Zamakhshari (d. 1144), al-Razi (d. 1210), and Ibn Kathir (d. 1373)
  - the term entered English academic writing by the late 19th century; 20th-century usage grew with modernist and reformist commentaries (e.g., Muhammad Abduh, Sayyid Qutb)
