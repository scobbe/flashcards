## Delian League
---
- **definition:**
  - a confederation of Greek city-states led by Athens, formed after the Persian Wars to deter Persia, named for Delos
  - by the mid-5th century BCE, the Athenian maritime empire that grew out of that alliance
- **etymology:**
  - delian from Delos (Greek Dēlos), literally 'clear, manifest,' with English -ian meaning 'of or relating to'
  - league from Middle French ligue and Italian lega, ultimately from Latin ligare 'to bind, tie'
  - formed in English as a compound: Delian + League
- **history:**
  - founded c. 478 BCE after Greek victories over Persia; the league’s treasury was first kept on Delos, a neutral sacred island
  - Athens moved the treasury to Athens in 454 BCE and enforced tribute; revolts (e.g., Naxos, Thasos) signaled its shift into an empire under leaders like Cimon and Pericles
  - its dominance helped trigger the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BCE); after Athens’ defeat in 404 BCE the league was dismantled; the term became common in English historiography by the 19th century
