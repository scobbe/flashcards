## Acropolis of Athens
---
- **definition:**
  - the ancient fortified hilltop in Athens crowned by the Parthenon and other classical temples
  - by extension, the central sacred precinct of classical Athens and a symbol of ancient Greek civilization
- **etymology:**
  - from Greek Akrópolis: akros "highest" + polis "city," literally "high city" or "citadel"
  - "Athens" from Greek Athēnai, the city's plural name, linked to the goddess Athena
  - the English phrase combines the Greek-derived noun "acropolis" with the place name "Athens" to specify this citadel
- **history:**
  - occupied since the Bronze Age (c. 1600–1100 BCE) as a fortified citadel; rebuilt in the 5th century BCE under Pericles with the Parthenon (447–432 BCE), Propylaea, Erechtheion, and Temple of Athena Nike
  - reused over centuries as a Christian church and later a mosque; the Parthenon was devastated in 1687 when a Venetian bombardment ignited an Ottoman powder magazine
  - in the early 1800s Lord Elgin removed sculptures (the "Elgin Marbles"); after Greek independence in the 1830s, systematic archaeology and restorations began; inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987
- **pronunciation:**
  - uh-KRAH-puh-lis of ATH-enz
