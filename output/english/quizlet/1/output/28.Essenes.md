## Essenes
---
- **definition:**
  - members of an ascetic Jewish sect of the Second Temple period, noted for communal life, ritual purity, and strict discipline
  - the sect itself as a collective, described by ancient authors such as Josephus, Philo, and Pliny
- **etymology:**
  - from Latin Esseni (plural), via Greek Essēnoi/Essaioi (Ἐσσηνοί/Ἐσσαῖοι), the names used in classical sources
  - likely from Aramaic ḥasyā or Hebrew ḥasid meaning “pious (ones),” a descriptive epithet for the group
  - an alternative proposal links it to Aramaic ʾāsayya “healers,” from ʾāsā “to heal,” reflecting reputed practices
- **history:**
  - attested in Greek and Latin accounts of Judea in the 2nd century BCE–1st century CE; first recorded in English in the mid-16th century through translations and scholarship
  - portrayed by Philo, Josephus, and Pliny as a celibate, communal movement; many scholars associate them with the Qumran settlement and the Dead Sea Scrolls (discovered in 1947)
  - the sect declined after the First Jewish–Roman War (66–73 CE) and the 70 CE destruction of the Second Temple; modern usage centers on historical and archaeological discussions
- **pronunciation:**
  - eh-SEENZ
