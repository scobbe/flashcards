## Mulled wine
---
- **definition:**
  - a hot drink made by heating wine—usually red—with sugar, citrus, and warming spices like cinnamon and cloves
  - by extension, any similar spiced, heated wine served during winter festivities
- **etymology:**
  - compound of mulled + wine; mulled is the past participle of the English verb mull meaning “to heat, sweeten, and spice (a beverage)”
  - mull in this sense is of uncertain origin, possibly related to a verb meaning “to soften” (cf. Latin mollis “soft”) or to “grind” (referring to spices)
  - wine comes from Old English wīn, borrowed via Proto-Germanic from Latin vinum, literally “wine”
- **history:**
  - spiced wine has ancient roots in Rome (e.g., conditum, mulsum, 1st–2nd century CE) and spread through medieval Europe in forms like hippocras
  - the phrase mulled wine is attested in English by the early 17th century (c. 1610s–1620s), as sugar and imported spices became more accessible
  - in 19th‑century Britain it became linked with Christmas; Charles Dickens popularized variants like “Smoking Bishop” in A Christmas Carol (1843); today it’s a staple of European winter markets (glühwein, vin chaud, glögg)
- **pronunciation:**
  - MULD wine
