- **history:**
  - emerged in Judea in the 2nd century BCE under Hasmonean rule, stressing oral law, ritual purity, and lay piety alongside rivals like the Sadducees
  - depicted in the New Testament (1st century CE) as debating Jesus; after the Temple’s destruction in 70 CE, Pharisaic teachings helped shape Rabbinic Judaism
  - attested in English by the late 14th century through Bible translations; by the 16th century it gained the figurative sense “hypocrite,” common in Reformation polemics
