## Paterfamilias
---
- **definition:**
  - the male head of a household; the father seen as the family's authority
  - in Roman law, the senior male who held legal power over household members and property
- **etymology:**
  - from Latin paterfamilias (also pater familias): pater 'father' + familia 'household,' with familias an archaic genitive meaning 'of the household'
  - literally 'father of the household'; borrowed into English in the 16th century through legal and scholarly use of Latin
- **history:**
  - in ancient Rome (Republic and Empire), the paterfamilias exercised patria potestas—authority over property, marriage, adoption, and dependents; aspects trace back to the Twelve Tables (c. 450 BCE)
  - the term appears in English by 1582 amid Renaissance interest in Roman law and governance, used by lawyers and scholars to discuss household authority
  - in the 18th–19th centuries, especially the Victorian era, it became a cultural ideal of domestic leadership; in modern English it is often neutral or slightly ironic for a family's father figure rather than a formal legal role
