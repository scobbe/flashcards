## Rabbinic Judaism
---
- **definition:**
  - the mainstream form of Judaism that developed after the Second Temple’s destruction, centered on rabbinic authority and the Oral Torah
  - a legal-religious system grounded in the Mishnah and Talmud that guides Jewish belief, law, and practice
- **etymology:**
  - from rabbinic: Hebrew rabbi (“my master/teacher”), via Late Latin rabbinus, with the adjective suffix -ic
  - from Judaism: Latin Iudaismus ← Greek Ioudaismos (“the religion/customs of the Jews”), from Ioudaios (“Jew”), ultimately from Hebrew Yehudah (Judah)
  - as a compound, it literally means “Judaism of the rabbis”
- **history:**
  - emerged after 70 CE, when the Second Temple was destroyed; rabbinic leadership coalesced at Yavneh and the Mishnah was compiled c. 200 CE by Judah ha-Nasi
  - consolidated in the Talmudic era: Jerusalem Talmud (4th–5th c.) and Babylonian Talmud (5th–6th c.); became normative across Jewish communities during the Geonic period (7th–11th c.)
  - the English label gained currency in 19th–20th c. scholarship to distinguish it from Second Temple practices, Karaite movements, and later denominational forms; today it denotes the mainstream halakhic tradition
- **pronunciation:**
  - ra-BIN-ik JOO-dee-iz-uhm
