## Sabaen (alphabet)
---
- **definition:**
  - the ancient South Arabian consonant-only script used to write Sabaic and related languages of Yemen
  - also used for the broader South Arabian “musnad” script family, ancestral to the Ethiopic (Ge’ez) script
- **etymology:**
  - from english Sabaean, via Latin Sabaeus and Greek Sabaios/Sabaioi, meaning “of Saba (Sheba)”; from Semitic Sabaʾ, the ancient South Arabian kingdom’s name
  - alphabet from Greek alphabētos, formed from alpha + beta, the first two letters
- **history:**
  - in use across southern Arabia c. 800 BCE–600 CE for Sabaic, Minaic, Qatabanic, and Hadramitic inscriptions, typically right-to-left and carved in monumental “musnad” style
  - after late antiquity and the spread of Arabic (7th century CE), it fell out of use in Arabia; in the Horn of Africa it influenced and likely gave rise to the Ge’ez/Ethiopic script (which added vowels and shifted to left-to-right)
  - european study expanded in the 18th–19th centuries: Carsten Niebuhr copied early finds; decipherment advanced by mid-1800s; Joseph Halévy and Eduard Glaser assembled major inscription collections
- **pronunciation:**
  - suh-BEE-uhn AL-fuh-bet
