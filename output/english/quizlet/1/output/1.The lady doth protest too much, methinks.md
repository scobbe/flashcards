## The lady doth protest too much, methinks
---
- **definition:**
  - said when someone denies something so strongly or so often that it seems insincere
  - used ironically to suggest the opposite is true—hinting at hidden guilt, desire, or embarrassment
- **etymology:**
  - from Early Modern English, a Shakespearean phrasing; doth is the archaic third-person singular of do (from Old English dōþ)
  - protest comes via French and Latin (Latin protestari, “declare publicly, affirm”), originally meaning “to avow” rather than “to object”
  - lady traces to Old English hlæfdige (“bread-kneader; mistress of a household”); too much is a native English intensifier phrase
- **history:**
  - first appears in English in Shakespeare’s Hamlet (act 3, scene 2), performed c. 1600–1601 and printed in the early 1600s
  - in the scene, Gertrude reacts to the Player Queen’s extreme vows; at the time protest meant “solemnly declare,” so the line critiques over-vowing
  - by the 19th–20th centuries the quotation had become an idiom meaning “deny too emphatically,” often shortened to protest too much in journalism and everyday speech
- **pronunciation:**
  - thuh LAY-dee duth pro-TEST too MUCH
