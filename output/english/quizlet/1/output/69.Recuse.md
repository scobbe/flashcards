## Recuse
---
- **definition:**
  - to remove yourself from a case or decision because of a conflict of interest or possible bias
  - to disqualify a judge, juror, or official from a case due to potential bias
- **etymology:**
  - from Anglo-/Middle French recuser “to challenge, reject (a judge),” used in legal contexts
  - from Latin recusare “to refuse, object,” built from re- “back/against” + causari “to give a reason, plead” (from causa “cause, reason”)
- **history:**
  - first recorded in English in the early 1600s, used in courts to challenge a judge or juror for bias as common-law procedures formalized
  - the reflexive form “recuse oneself” spread in American usage in the 20th century, reinforced by federal law (28 U.S.C. § 455, 1974) after Watergate
  - news coverage often highlights high-profile recusals or non-recusals, e.g., debates over U.S. Supreme Court cases (such as the 2004 Cheney matter) and officials’ recusals in 2017
