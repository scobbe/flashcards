  - Pheidippos combines pheid- “thrifty, sparing” + híppos “horse” (i.e., “thrifty with horses”)
  - entered English via Latinized/classical Greek forms used in historical and literary texts
- **history:**
  - 490 BCE: Herodotus records Pheidippides as a hemerodromos who ran from Athens to Sparta (~240 km) seeking aid before the Battle of Marathon
  - 1st–2nd c. CE: later writers (Plutarch, Lucian) popularized the tale of a run from Marathon to Athens, crying “We have won!” before dying; sources differ on the messenger’s name
  - 1896: the modern Olympic marathon was created to honor the legend; Pheidippides became an icon of endurance, inspiring events like the Spartathlon (first run in 1983) tracing the Athens–Sparta route
