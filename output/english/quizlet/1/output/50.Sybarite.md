## Sybarite
---
- **definition:**
  - a person devoted to luxury, pleasure, and comfortable living
  - historically, a native or inhabitant of ancient Sybaris
- **etymology:**
  - from Latin Sybarita, via Greek Sybaritēs, meaning "inhabitant of Sybaris"
  - built from the place-name Sybaris + the suffix -itēs/-ite meaning "person from"
  - entered English through classical sources (also French sybarite), shifting from a demonym to a common noun
- **history:**
  - sybaris, a Greek colony in southern Italy (Magna Graecia), flourished c. 720–510 BCE and was famed in antiquity for wealth and luxury; classical writers like Strabo and Athenaeus spread its opulent image
  - the word appears in English by the 1590s, first as a capitalized demonym; soon after it broadened to mean a pleasure-lover or voluptuary
  - by the 17th–18th centuries it was a moralizing byword for decadence, and the adjective sybaritic (attested early 1600s) reinforced the association with lavish indulgence
- **pronunciation:**
  - SIB-uh-ryte
