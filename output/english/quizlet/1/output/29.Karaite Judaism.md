## Karaite Judaism
---
- **definition:**
  - a Jewish movement that accepts only the Hebrew Bible as binding law, rejecting the Oral Torah (Talmud) as authoritative
  - the religious tradition and communities that follow this scripturalist approach within Judaism
- **etymology:**
  - from Hebrew kara'im “readers,” based on qara “to read, proclaim,” referring to reliance on the written Scripture
  - via medieval Hebrew and Arabic (al‑Qara’iyyah) into European languages; English Karaite is attested by the early modern period
  - Judaism comes from Greek Ioudaismos via Latin Iudaismus, ultimately from Hebrew Yehudah “Judah”
- **history:**
  - emerged in the early medieval Islamic world (8th–9th c. CE), often linked to Anan ben David in Baghdad, though Karaites trace roots to earlier scripturalist currents
  - flourished in the 10th–12th c. with centers in Jerusalem, Ramla, and Fustat (Cairo); key scholars include Ya‘qub al‑Qirqisani and Yefet ben ‘Ali, amid debates with Rabbanites such as Saadia Gaon
  - from the late medieval period to modern times, communities spread to Crimea and Lithuania; in the 19th c. the Russian Empire granted Crimean/Lithuanian Karaites distinct legal status; today small communities exist in Israel, Eastern Europe, and the U.S.
