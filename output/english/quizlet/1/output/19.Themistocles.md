## Themistocles
---
- **definition:**
  - an Athenian statesman and general (c. 524–459 BCE) who built Athens’s navy and led the Greek victory at Salamis against Persia
  - a male given name taken from the ancient figure (rare)
- **etymology:**
  - from Ancient Greek Themistoklēs, built from themis “law, custom, divine order” + kleos “glory, fame”
  - Latinized as Themistocles and then adopted into English through classical learning and translations
  - formed as a typical Greek compound personal name meaning “glory of law/order”
- **history:**
  - c. 524–459 BCE; promoted using the Laurion silver strike to build a fleet (483/482 BCE) and shaped the strategy that won the Battle of Salamis (480 BCE) in the Greco-Persian Wars
  - after consolidating influence and fortifying Piraeus, he was ostracized (471 BCE), later accused of treason, fled to Persia, was granted Magnesia to govern, and died there (traditionally c. 459 BCE)
  - the name became familiar in English via Renaissance translations of Plutarch’s Life of Themistocles, especially Thomas North’s version (1579), which framed him as a shrewd, visionary leader

  - thuh-MIS-tuh-kleez
