## Amoy
---
- **definition:**
  - the former English name for Xiamen, a port city in Fujian, China
  - the Southern Min (Hokkien) dialect spoken in and around Xiamen; also called Xiamenese
- **etymology:**
  - from the local Southern Min (Hokkien) name for 厦门, heard by Europeans as "E-mui"/"E-mng"
  - borrowed into English via Portuguese and Dutch spellings, with "moy" approximating the Hokkien -ui sound
  - built from Chinese characters 厦 xià "mansion, large building" + 门 mén "gate," the literal elements of the place name
- **history:**
  - recorded in European maps and travelogues from the 1600s as traders reached Fujian’s coast
  - captured by the British in 1841 during the First Opium War; opened as a treaty port in 1842, fixing "Amoy" in Western usage
  - after China adopted pinyin (from 1979 onward), "Xiamen" replaced "Amoy" officially, though the older name persists for the dialect and in historical works
- **pronunciation:**
  - uh-MOY
