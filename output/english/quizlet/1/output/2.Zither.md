## Zither
---
- **definition:**
  - a stringed instrument with many strings stretched across a flat body, played by plucking or strumming
  - by extension, any member of a family of flat-bodied string instruments (such as the concert zither or autoharp)
- **etymology:**
  - borrowed into english in the mid-19th century from german Zither
  - from latin cithara and ultimately greek kithara, meaning “lyre” or “harp-like instrument”
  - the shift from c/k to z reflects german spelling/pronunciation; it shares the ancient root with “guitar” and “cittern”
- **history:**
  - first attested in english in the mid-1800s, as the modern concert zither spread from alpine regions (austria, bavaria, tyrol) during a boom in parlor and folk music
  - popular through 19th-century central europe via virtuosos and urban salons; usage waned with the rise of accordion and guitar, then surged globally in 1949 with anton karas’s zither theme for The Third Man
  - in the 20th–21st centuries it persists in central european folk traditions and periodic revivals in folk, film, and niche classical settings
- **pronunciation:**
  - ZITH-er
