## Sadducees
---
- **definition:**
  - members of a Jewish sect active in Jerusalem before 70 CE, associated with the priestly elite and the Temple
  - people known for accepting only the written Torah and rejecting beliefs like resurrection and angels
- **etymology:**
  - from Latin Sadducaei and Greek Saddoukaioi, the New Testament term for the group
  - ultimately from Hebrew/Aramaic sadduqim/sadduqai, often explained as “followers of Zadok” (a high priest), from the root ṣdq meaning “righteous”
  - the English singular Sadducee is back-formed from the plural name of the sect
- **history:**
  - emerged in Judea in the 2nd century BCE during the Hasmonean period as a Temple-centered, aristocratic faction opposed to the Pharisees
  - noted by Josephus and in the New Testament (1st century CE) for denying resurrection and oral law; influential under Hasmonean and Herodian rule
  - lost power after the Temple’s destruction in 70 CE and the sect vanished; the term entered English by the late 14th century via Bible translations, later standardized in the 1611 King James Bible
- **pronunciation:**
  - SAD-yoo-seez
