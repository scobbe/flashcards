## Rake (rakish)
---
- **definition:**
  - a dissolute, immoral man who pursues pleasure recklessly, especially in sex and drink (rake)
  - stylishly disreputable or dashing; sometimes with a slightly tilted or slanted look (rakish)
- **etymology:**
  - derived from rakehell (16th c.), an English compound literally meaning “hell‑raker”; clipped to rake in the 17th century
  - rakehell was likely influenced by Middle English rakel “rash, headstrong” (compare reckless), reinforcing the sense of wild behavior
  - rakish formed with the suffix -ish from rake (libertine) in the late 17th century; its appearance-based sense broadened from the image of fashionable rakes
- **history:**
  - first attested as rakehell in the 1540s; the shortened rake became prominent in Restoration England (c. 1660–1700), amid a culture of aristocratic libertinism
  - restoration comedies and figures like John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, popularized the type; Hogarth’s A Rake's Progress (1732–34) satirized the rake’s downfall
  - by the 18th–19th centuries, rakish shifted from moral judgment to style, coming to mean “dashing” or “fashionably disreputable,” applied to hats, ships, and later cars
- **pronunciation:**
  - rayk; RAY-kish
