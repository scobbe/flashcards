## Avesta
---
- **definition:**
  - the primary collection of sacred texts of Zoroastrianism, composed in the Avestan language
  - by extension, a liturgical prayerbook containing selections from those texts (often the Khordeh Avesta)
- **etymology:**
  - from Middle Persian abestāg meaning "the text, scripture"; the exact earlier origin is uncertain
  - possibly related to an Old Iranian/Avestan root meaning "to stand, support" or "to establish" (sometimes linked to upa-stā-), but this derivation is debated
  - borrowed into European languages via French Zend-Avesta (1771), where zend means "commentary" and is not part of the original title
- **history:**
  - the oldest portions (the Gathas) are attributed to Zarathustra and are often dated roughly to 1200–600 BCE; the corpus was transmitted orally for centuries
  - the canon was compiled and redacted under the Sasanian Empire (3rd–7th century CE); a larger "Great Avesta" was later largely lost, with surviving parts including the Yasna, Visperad, Vendidad, Yashts, and Khordeh Avesta; most extant manuscripts date from about the 13th century onward
  - European study accelerated after Anquetil-Duperron’s Zend-Avesta (1771); the term Avesta entered English in the early 19th century, and 19th‑century scholars such as Rasmus Rask and Martin Haug advanced Avestan philology
- **pronunciation:**
  - uh-VES-tuh
