## West Germanic languages
---
- **definition:**
  - a branch of the Germanic language family that includes English, German, Dutch, Frisian, Afrikaans, Yiddish, and related tongues
  - the subgroup of Germanic contrasted with North and the now-extinct East Germanic branches
- **etymology:**
  - formed in english as a compound label: "west" + "germanic" + "languages" for a classification category
  - west from old english west, from proto-germanic westrą, ultimately from proto-indo-european wes- meaning "evening, west"
  - germanic from latin Germanicus "of the Germani" (via french germanique); language from old french langage, from latin lingua "tongue, speech"
- **history:**
  - the west germanic branch differentiated by the late roman/early medieval era; earliest texts include old english (7th c.) and old high german (8th c.)
  - the high german consonant shift (c. 6th–8th c.) drove a major internal split between high german and low german/low franconian
  - the term and systematic grouping were formalized in 19th‑century comparative philology (e.g., rask, grimm, schleicher), entering english by the mid‑1800s; from the 1600s onward, english and dutch expansion spread west germanic languages globally
- **pronunciation:**
  - west jer-MAN-ik LANG-gwih-jiz
