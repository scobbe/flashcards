## Breton language
---
- **definition:**
  - a Celtic language spoken in Brittany (northwest France), closely related to Welsh and Cornish
  - the traditional speech of the Breton people; today a regional/minority language undergoing revival
- **etymology:**
  - from the English adjective "Breton," via Old French breton, from Latin Britto/Brittones “Briton(s)”
  - “language” comes from Old French langage, from Latin lingua “tongue, speech”
  - the native endonym brezhoneg combines brezhon “Breton” with the suffix -eg “language/related to”
- **history:**
  - c. 5th–6th centuries: Brittonic speakers from Britain settled Armorica (later Brittany), giving rise to Breton distinct from Welsh and Cornish
  - 9th–15th centuries: earliest traces appear as Breton names and glosses in Latin charters; in 1499 Jehan Lagadeuc printed the trilingual Catholicon, a landmark dictionary
  - 19th–21st centuries: French monolingual policies caused decline; the 1951 Deixonne Law allowed limited teaching; since 1977 Diwan immersion schools have driven revival, though UNESCO classifies Breton as endangered
