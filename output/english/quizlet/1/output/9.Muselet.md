## Muselet
---
- **definition:**
  - a small twisted wire cage that secures the cork on a bottle of Champagne or other sparkling wine against internal pressure
  - by extension, the complete wire-and-cap assembly used to fasten such corks
- **etymology:**
  - from French muselet, literally "little muzzle," formed with the diminutive suffix -et
  - from French museler "to muzzle" and museau "muzzle, snout," referring to restraining the cork
  - built on the idea of a small muzzle holding something in place
- **history:**
  - before the mid-1800s, sparkling wine corks were held with string or hemp, a risky method prone to leaks and bottle bursts
  - in 1844 Adolphe Jacquesson (of Champagne Jacquesson) patented the wire cage and cap, which rapidly became standard in Champagne
  - the French term entered English wine-trade writing by the early 1900s; late 20th-century branding turned the cap discs into collectible designs
- **pronunciation:**
  - myoo-zuh-LAY
