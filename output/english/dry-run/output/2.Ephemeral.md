## Ephemeral
---
- **definition:**
  - lasting a very short time; short-lived, fleeting
  - intended to be used or enjoyed briefly, not meant to last (as in ephemeral art or events)
- **etymology:**
  - from Greek ephēmeros, meaning 'lasting only a day,' from epi 'for' + hēmera 'day'
  - entered English via Late Latin ephemerus/ephemeralis and French éphémère, formed with the -al adjective ending
  - related to the noun ephemera, 'short-lived things,' from the same Greek root
- **history:**
  - first recorded in English in the 1570s in medical contexts for a one-day illness ('ephemeral fever')
  - by the early 1600s it broadened to mean generally 'short-lived,' a sense common in 17th-century literature concerned with transience
  - in science and culture it attached to brief-lived phenomena: 18th-19th centuries for mayflies (Linnaeus's genus Ephemera, later order Ephemeroptera) and, by the mid-20th century, to 'ephemeral art' and 'printed ephemera'
- **pronunciation:**
  - ih-FEM-uh-rul
