## Rostrum
---
- **definition:**
  - a raised platform for speeches, auctions, or performances
  - a beak or beak‑like projection; in anatomy and zoology, any snout‑like part
  - the projecting ram or prow of an ancient warship
- **etymology:**
  - from Latin rostrum “beak, snout; ship’s ram/prow,” with plural rostra “beaks”
  - formed on Latin rodere “to gnaw” + the instrumental suffix -trum, literally “gnawing/beaking tool”
  - by semantic transfer in Latin, rostra (ship prows) named Rome’s speakers’ platform; English later applied rostrum to any speaking platform
- **history:**
  - 338 BCE: after Rome’s victory at Antium, captured ship prows (rostra) were fixed to the Forum platform, which became the Rostra
  - 1st century BCE: orators like Cicero addressed crowds from the Rostra, tying the term to public political speech
  - in English, the beak/ship sense appears by the 1540s; the platform sense is attested by 1766, and “auctioneer’s rostrum” by 1796 amid neoclassical revival
- **pronunciation:**
  - ROS-trum
