## Vesak
---
- **definition:**
  - a major Buddhist festival marking the Buddha’s birth, enlightenment, and passing, observed on the full moon in April–May
  - the lunar month (Vaisakha/Vesak) in South Asian calendars during which the festival falls
- **etymology:**
  - from Pali vesākha and Sanskrit vaiśākha, “of Viśākhā,” the lunar mansion/asterism (literally ‘forked/branched’)
  - entered English via Sinhala Vesak/Wesak; spelling reflects adaptation from Pali/Sanskrit month-name into local usage
- **history:**
  - observed since ancient India as Vesākha Pūrṇimā; full‑moon rites (uposatha) gained wide support by the 3rd century BCE under Mauryan patronage, including Ashoka
  - the World Fellowship of Buddhists in 1950 endorsed Vesak to mark the Buddha’s birth; in 1999 the UN recognized the International Day of Vesak
  - the term appears in English from the late 19th century (often as Wesak) in accounts of British Ceylon; modern usage favors Vesak, especially in Theravada countries
