## Bravura Shot
---
- **definition:**
  - a showy, technically complex camera shot meant to display a director or cinematographer’s skill, often a long take or intricate move
  - by extension, any conspicuously stylish filmed moment designed to impress the viewer
- **etymology:**
  - from Italian bravura (“boldness; display of skill”), from bravo (“bold; skillful”), adopted into English via musical usage
  - shot from Old English shoot/sceotan (“to throw, shoot”); the noun’s film sense arises from the idea of “shooting” with a camera
  - formed in English as a compound: the Italian loanword bravura used attributively + the English noun shot
- **history:**
  - bravura entered English in the 18th century in music criticism to label virtuosic, show-off passages
  - by the mid–late 20th century, film critics applied “bravura” to cinema; the phrase “bravura shot” appears in criticism by the 1970s–1980s
  - famous exemplars include Hitchcock’s Rope (1948) and Welles’s Touch of Evil opening (1958); the Steadicam (1975) and later digital tools enabled later showpieces like Goodfellas’ Copacabana shot (1990), Children of Men (2006), and Birdman (2014)
