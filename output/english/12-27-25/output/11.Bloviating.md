## Bloviating
---
- **definition:**
  - talking at tedious length in a pompous, showy, or empty way
  - delivering long-winded remarks that sound important but say little
- **etymology:**
  - american English coinage (mid-19th century) formed from blow “to boast; talk loudly” (ultimately from Old English blāwan “to blow”)
  - combined with a mock-Latin suffix -viate, modeled on verbs like deviate (from Latin dēviāre “to turn aside,” from via “road, way”), to give a humorous, grandiose feel
- **history:**
  - first recorded in American usage in 1845, reflecting the era’s fondness for colorful newspaper slang and expansive stump oratory
  - widely popularized in the 1920s by U.S. President Warren G. Harding (1921–23), who joked about his own “bloviating” and was known for windy speeches
  - since the late 20th century it has been common in political commentary to criticize verbose, substance-light talk
