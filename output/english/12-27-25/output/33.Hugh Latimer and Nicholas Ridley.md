---
- **definition:**
  - two English Protestant bishops of the 1500s, remembered as martyrs burned at Oxford in 1555 under Queen Mary I
  - a paired reference symbolizing steadfast Protestant faith during the English Reformation
- **etymology:**
  - hugh from Old French Hugues, from Germanic hug meaning “mind, spirit”; latimer is an Anglo‑Norman occupational surname from Old French/Medieval Latin (latinier/latinarius) meaning “interpreter (of Latin)”
  - nicholas from Greek Nikolaos “victory of the people” (nikē “victory” + laos “people”); ridley is an English place‑name surname from Old English hrēod “reed” + lēah “clearing, meadow”
- **history:**
  - both were leading reforming bishops under Henry VIII and Edward VI (Latimer of Worcester; Ridley of London), then deposed and tried for heresy after Mary I’s Catholic restoration in 1553
  - they were burned at the stake in Oxford on 16 October 1555 during the Marian persecutions; latimer’s words to ridley about “lighting a candle” became a famous Protestant rallying line
  - their story, popularized by John Foxe’s Acts and Monuments (1563), shaped English Protestant identity; they are commemorated as two of the Oxford Martyrs, with a public memorial erected in Oxford (1841–43)
