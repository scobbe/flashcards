## Lingnan
---
- **definition:**
  - a historical-geographic region of southern China south of the Nanling Mountains (covering Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, and nearby areas)
  - relating to the people, culture, or institutions of that region; often used attributively (e.g., 'Lingnan cuisine')
- **etymology:**
  - from Mandarin Chinese Lǐngnán (岭南), literally "south of the mountain ridges" (lǐng "ridge, range" + nán "south")
  - entered English through Chinese romanization; earlier Wade–Giles/missionary forms "Ling-nan" later standardized to Pinyin "Lingnan"
  - a classical Chinese toponymic compound formed by naming a geographic feature plus a cardinal direction
- **history:**
  - the toponym is ancient in China; after the Han annexation of the Nanyue kingdom (111 BCE), "Lingnan" marked the southern frontier spanning today’s Guangdong–Guangxi–Hainan
  - during the Tang and Song eras (7th–13th c.), "Lingnan" named administrative circuits (later split into east and west) as Guangzhou grew into a Maritime Silk Road hub
  - the term appears in English by the mid-19th century (often "Ling-nan") in missionary and colonial writings on Canton; in the 20th c. it spread via Lingnan University and the Lingnan School of painting
- **pronunciation:**
  - ling-NAN
