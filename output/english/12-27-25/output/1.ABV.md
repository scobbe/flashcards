## ABV
---
- **definition:**
  - a standard measure of how much alcohol (ethanol) is in a drink, expressed as a percentage of the total volume
  - used on labels to compare the strength of beers, wines, and spirits (for example, 5% abv)
- **etymology:**
  - formed in English as an initialism of "alcohol by volume"
  - alcohol from Arabic al-kuhl ("the kohl"), via Medieval Latin alcohol, broadened to mean distilled spirit
  - volume from Latin volumen ("roll, scroll"), later "bulk, size"; by from Old English bi ("near; by means of")
- **history:**
  - mid-20th century: adopted in scientific and regulatory contexts as a metric alternative to "proof," with measurement standardized at 20°C
  - 1987: the European Community required alcoholic strength "by volume" on most beverage labels, accelerating global adoption of ABV
  - 1990s–present: consumer use grew with the craft beer and spirits boom; in the US, ABV commonly appears alongside "proof" (proof = 2× ABV)
- **pronunciation:**
  - ay-BEE-vee
