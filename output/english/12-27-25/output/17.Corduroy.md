## Corduroy
---
- **definition:**
  - a durable cotton (or cotton-blend) fabric with raised parallel ridges, used for clothes and upholstery
  - trousers made from this fabric (often used in the plural: corduroys)
  - a rough roadway made of logs laid crosswise; also, to surface a road that way
- **etymology:**
  - english formation from cord + duroy, meaning “corded duroy”; duroy was a coarse woolen cloth name in 17th–18th‑century English
  - duroy’s deeper origin is uncertain, possibly via older English textile terms; the compound likely described the fabric’s ribbed structure
  - the road and verb senses arose by analogy to the cloth’s ridged look
- **history:**
  - first recorded for the textile in late 1700s; production expanded in Britain’s Industrial Revolution, especially around Manchester and Yorkshire mills
  - by the early–mid 1800s, “corduroy road” was common on North American frontiers and in military supply routes, notably during the U.S. Civil War (1861–65)
  - worn by laborers and schoolchildren in the 19th–early 20th c.; adopted by students and academics mid‑20th c.; revived in 1970s casual fashion and again in the late 1990s–2000s
