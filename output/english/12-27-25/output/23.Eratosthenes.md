## Eratosthenes
---
- **definition:**
  - the proper name of a Greek scholar (c. 276–194 BCE), famed for measuring Earth’s circumference and for the prime-number “sieve” named after him
- **etymology:**
  - from Ancient Greek Eratosthenēs (Ἐρατοσθένης), built from eratos “beloved, lovely” + sthenos “strength, vigor,” literally “beloved strength”
  - entered English through Latinized forms in classical and Renaissance scholarship; the spelling follows Latin transliteration of the Greek name
- **history:**
  - c. 276–194 BCE: born in Cyrene; served as chief librarian at the Library of Alexandria under Ptolemy III; around 240 BCE he estimated Earth’s circumference using sun angles at Syene and Alexandria with remarkable accuracy
  - in the Hellenistic period he advanced geography (coining the term and mapping the known world), astronomy (estimating Earth’s axial tilt), and mathematics (the prime-number sieve), influencing later figures like Strabo and Ptolemy
  - his name reemerged prominently in European learning during the Renaissance (15th–16th centuries); by the 19th century English texts widely referred to the algorithm as the “sieve of Eratosthenes”
- **pronunciation:**
  - air-uh-TOS-thuh-neez
