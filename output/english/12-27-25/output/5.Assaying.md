## Assaying
---
- **definition:**
  - testing and measuring a metal, ore, or other sample to determine its components or quality
  - making an attempt or trial (archaic/literary)
- **etymology:**
  - from Middle English assaien/assayen “to try, test,” via Anglo-Norman/Old French essai “trial” and essayer “to try”
  - from Late Latin exagiare “to weigh” and exagium “a weighing, test” (ex- “out” + agere “to drive/do”)
  - formed as the present participle/gerund of the verb “assay” with the -ing ending
- **history:**
  - attested in English by the late 13th–early 14th century meaning “to try or test,” amid growing craft and legal quality controls
  - by the 15th–16th centuries it specialized in metallurgy and coinage; European assay offices (e.g., London) formalized hallmarking, with a date-letter system in 1478
  - in 19th-century gold and silver rushes assaying became central to mining and minting; in the 20th century it broadened to standardized chemical and bioassays
