## Mizrahi

- **definition:**
  - relating to Jews of Middle Eastern and North African origin; a person from those communities
  - hebrew for 'eastern'; also used as an adjective or a surname
- **etymology:**
  - from Hebrew mizrahi, literally 'eastern,' formed from mizrah 'east' + the -i adjectival suffix meaning 'of/from'
  - mizrah comes from the Semitic root z‑r‑ḥ 'to rise/shine (of the sun)'; the word entered English via Modern Hebrew
- **history:**
  - first appears in English in the mid‑20th century, especially after Israel’s 1948 founding, to describe Jews immigrating from Arab and Muslim countries
  - in Israel, protests like the Wadi Salib riots (1959) and the Israeli Black Panthers (1971) highlighted discrimination against Mizrahim
  - since the 1980s the term has broadened into a cultural identity (e.g., Mizrahi music) and is often contrasted with Ashkenazi; usage can overlap with 'Sephardi'
