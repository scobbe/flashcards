## Lapsang Souchang
---
- **definition:**
  - a Chinese black tea from Fujian’s Wuyi Mountains, traditionally smoke-dried over pine wood, known for a bold smoky aroma
  - the dried leaves of this tea or a brew made from them
- **etymology:**
  - from southern Chinese dialects via the tea trade; souchong reflects Cantonese siu zung (小種) “small kind/variety,” a leaf‑grade term
  - lapsang reflects a regional term linked to Zhengshan (正山 “original mountain”) or to pinewood smoking in Fujian dialects; the name follows the pattern “[descriptor/place] + [grade]”
- **history:**
  - first recorded in English in the early 19th century as a distinct Chinese black tea imported by European traders
  - traced to Tongmu, Wuyi Mountains, in the 1600s (late Ming/early Qing), reportedly created when leaves were hastily smoke‑dried over pine due to wartime disruption
  - gained niche popularity in 18th–19th‑century Europe and later; associated with “Russian caravan” blends and connoisseur circles
- **pronunciation:**
  - LAP-sang SOO-chong
