## Manus
---
- **definition:**
  - the hand; in anatomy, the end part of the forelimb including the wrist and fingers
  - in zoology and paleontology, the distal part of a forelimb (the “hand” or forefoot) of an animal
  - in Roman law (historical), a husband's legal authority over his wife
- **etymology:**
  - from Latin manus “hand,” a noun meaning literally “hand”
  - ultimately from a Proto-Indo-European root meaning “hand,” preserved in English as a learned borrowing
  - entered English via New Latin scientific usage, keeping the Latin form for technical precision
- **history:**
  - in classical Rome (1st c. BCE–2nd c. CE), manus in legal texts denoted a husband's authority; English scholars later retained the Latin term when discussing Roman marriage
  - the anatomical sense appears in English medical writing by the 1600s, as Latinized body-part nomenclature (paired with pes “foot”) was standardized
  - by the 19th century, zoologists and paleontologists routinely used manus to describe animal forelimbs (e.g., dinosaur manus vs. pes), a practice that continues in technical descriptions
- **pronunciation:**
  - MAY-nuhs
