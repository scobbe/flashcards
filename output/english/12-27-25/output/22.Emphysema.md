## Emphysema
---
- **definition:**
  - a chronic lung disease where the tiny air sacs (alveoli) are destroyed, trapping air and making breathing hard
  - the abnormal presence of air in tissues (such as under the skin) due to injury or infection
- **etymology:**
  - from Greek emphysēma meaning "inflation, a swelling by blowing," from emphysan "to inflate" (en "in" + physa "bellows; breath")
  - borrowed into Latin as emphysema, then into English via medical Latin/French in the mid-17th century
  - built with the Greek suffix -ēma, forming nouns for the result of an action
- **history:**
  - first recorded in English medical texts in the 1660s, initially for air trapped in tissues after wounds or infections, noted by surgeons and anatomists
  - in 1819 René Laennec used the newly invented stethoscope to describe pulmonary emphysema and differentiate chest diseases during the rise of clinical pathology
  - mid-20th-century studies tied cigarette smoking and urban pollution to chronic bronchitis and emphysema; by the 1960s the term COPD spread, reinforced by reports like the 1964 U.S. Surgeon General’s
