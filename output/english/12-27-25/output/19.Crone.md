## Crone
---
- **definition:**
  - an old woman, often used disparagingly to suggest withered, witchlike, or ugly
  - in folklore and neopagan contexts, an archetype of the wise elder woman (the third phase after maiden and mother)
- **etymology:**
  - from Anglo-Norman/Old French caroigne/charoigne meaning “carrion; contemptible person,” from Latin caro, carnis “flesh”
  - the pejorative French sense was transferred into English and narrowed to refer specifically to an old woman; modern French charogne preserves the “carrion” meaning
- **history:**
  - attested in English by the late 14th to early 15th century, when late medieval Europe trafficked in stereotypes of hags and witches
  - in the 16th–17th centuries it appears in witch-trial pamphlets and folk narratives to label withered, malevolent old women; the figure aligns with European folklore archetypes like the Cailleach and Baba Yaga
  - from the 1970s onward, feminist and neopagan movements began reclaiming “crone” as a positive symbol of elder wisdom within the Maiden–Mother–Crone triad
- **pronunciation:**
  - KROHN
