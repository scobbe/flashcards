## Addled
---
- **definition:**
  - confused or unable to think clearly; muddled
  - rotten or spoiled, especially said of eggs
- **etymology:**
  - from Middle English adel/addle meaning 'foul, putrid,' ultimately from Old English adela meaning 'filth, mire'
  - formed as the past participle of the obsolete verb addle 'to make or become foul/rotten,' hence 'addled' = 'made foul'
  - unrelated to the obsolete verb addle meaning 'to earn,' which has a different origin
- **history:**
  - first recorded in English c. 1500 describing spoiled or non-developing eggs, a common concern in household and farm life
  - by the late 1500s (1590s) it developed the figurative sense 'muddled in mind,' yielding phrases like 'addled brains' or 'addled wits'
  - remained common in 17th–19th‑century writing and speech; today chiefly informal, often used humorously or mildly critically
