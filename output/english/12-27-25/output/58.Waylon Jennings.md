## Waylon Jennings
---
- **definition:**

  - the given name Waylon is a U.S. variant of Wayland/Weland, from Old English Wēland, the legendary smith; literally “craftsman/smith”

  - John ultimately comes from Hebrew Yohanan, meaning “Yahweh is gracious”
- **history:**
  - born in Texas in 1937; played bass for Buddy Holly in 1959 and narrowly missed the fatal “Day the Music Died” plane crash
