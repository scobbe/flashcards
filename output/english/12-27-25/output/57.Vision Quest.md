## Vision Quest
---
- **definition:**
  - a rite of passage in some Indigenous North American cultures where a person fasts and prays alone to seek a guiding vision
  - any personal journey undertaken to find purpose, direction, or insight, often through solitude and challenge
  - informally, a determined pursuit of a goal that someone feels called to achieve
- **etymology:**
  - english compound of vision + quest, literally "seeing" + "search"
  - vision from Latin visio "act of seeing," from videre "to see," via Old French and Middle English
  - quest from Old French queste "search, inquiry," from Latin quaerere "to seek, ask," entering Middle English as quest(e)
- **history:**
  - the practice is ancient among many Indigenous nations; the English phrase appears in print by the early 20th century in ethnographic accounts
  - black Elk Speaks (1932) and mid-20th-century anthropology popularized the concept for non-Native readers, shaping how the rite was framed
  - from the 1960s-1980s the term spread into counterculture, self-help, and pop culture (e.g., the 1985 film), and since then debates over misuse and cultural appropriation have intensified
