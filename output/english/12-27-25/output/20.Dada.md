## Dada
---
- **definition:**
  - an early 20th-century art movement that rejected reason and tradition, embracing absurdity, chance, and anti-art
  - a child's word for “father” in English, used in baby talk
- **etymology:**
  - from French dada “hobbyhorse” (a child’s toy), widely cited as the source of the movement’s name
  - ultimately from nursery babble syllables da-da; related forms for “daddy” or “hobbyhorse” occur across European languages
  - the derivative dadaism formed by adding the suffix -ism to Dada to label the movement
- **history:**
  - emerged in 1916 at Cabaret Voltaire in Zurich amid World War I; founders included Hugo Ball and Emmy Hennings, with Tristan Tzara and Jean Arp joining
  - spread to New York, Berlin, and Paris (1917–1922); figures like Marcel Duchamp, Hannah Höch, and Francis Picabia shaped its anti-art stance
  - by the mid-1920s it waned as many artists moved into Surrealism (Breton’s 1924 manifesto); the term Dada appears in English print by 1919, while the nursery “dada” is recorded earlier in the 19th century
- **pronunciation:**
  - DAH-dah
