## Nowruz
---
- **definition:**
  - a spring festival marking the Persian/Iranian New Year at the March equinox (also spelled Norooz, Navruz, Nauroz)
  - the first day of the Iranian calendar year, widely celebrated in Iran, Afghanistan, Central Asia, the Caucasus, and their diasporas
- **etymology:**
  - from Persian Nowruz (now/naw "new" + ruz/rooz "day"), literally "new day"; from Middle Persian nōg rōz
  - now traces back to Proto-Indo-European *newo- "new"; ruz comes from Middle Persian rōz "day," linked to Iranian roots for "day/light"
- **history:**
  - rooted in pre-Islamic Iran with Zoroastrian associations; observed under the Achaemenids (c. 550–330 BCE) and formalized in Sasanian times (224–651 CE)
  - endured after the 7th-century Islamic conquest and spread across the Persianate world—Central Asia, the Caucasus, and parts of South Asia—while retaining the spring-equinox new year
  - attested in English by the 19th century; recognized by UNESCO as Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2009 (expanded 2016) and by the UN as International Nowruz Day in 2010
- **pronunciation:**
  - noh-ROOZ
