## Legend of the White Snake
---
- **definition:**
  - a classic Chinese folk romance about a white snake spirit who becomes a woman, her love for the scholar Xu Xian, and her conflict with the monk Fahai
  - the standard English title for numerous adaptations in literature, opera, film, and television
- **etymology:**
  - from Mandarin Chinese Bái Shé Zhuàn (白蛇传/白蛇傳), literally “white snake tale/account”: bái = white, shé = snake, zhuàn = account/story
  - also rendered as “Madame White Snake,” reflecting Bái Niángzǐ (白娘子, “White Lady”), the heroine’s honorific name
  - the English phrase is a direct translation of the Chinese title used in scholarship and popular media
- **history:**
  - early forms trace to the Song dynasty (12th–13th centuries), with a lasting prose version in Feng Menglong’s 1624 collection Jing Shi Tong Yan (Stories to Caution the World)
  - by the Qing dynasty it was a staple of regional opera (Kunqu, Peking, Yue), closely linked to Hangzhou’s West Lake and Leifeng Pagoda; the pagoda’s 1924 collapse became a cultural touchstone
  - English retellings spread in the early 20th century (e.g., E. T. C. Werner’s Myths and Legends of China, 1922), with modern adaptations from Tsui Hark’s Green Snake (1993) to the animated White Snake (2019)
