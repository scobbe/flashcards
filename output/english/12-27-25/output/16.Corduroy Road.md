## Corduroy Road
---
- **definition:**
  - a rough road built from logs laid side by side across the route to cross mud or swampy ground
  - by extension, any very bumpy stretch of road with ridges that jolt vehicles
- **etymology:**
  - english compound of corduroy + road; corduroy is from cord (“string; rib”) + duroy (a coarse woolen cloth), with cord from Old French corde < Latin chorda < Greek chordē “string”
  - the name is descriptive, likening the road’s parallel logs to the raised ribs (“wales”) of corduroy fabric
- **history:**
  - attested in North American English by the early–mid 19th century, when settlers used log roads through mud; widely built during the U.S. Civil War (1861–1865) for supply routes
  - while the term is modern, timber trackways across bogs are ancient (e.g., the Sweet Track in Somerset, c. 3800 BCE); by the late 19th–20th centuries, corduroy roads yielded to plank, gravel, and paved roads but remain in logging and temporary access work
  - the phrase later took on a figurative sense for any rough, jolting ride, especially in 20th-century motoring commentary
- **pronunciation:**
