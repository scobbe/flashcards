## Seven Veils of Unreality
---
- **definition:**
  - a figurative phrase for layers of illusion or misperception that hide what is real
  - often used to suggest peeling back these layers one by one to reveal underlying truth
- **etymology:**
  - formed by combining the established idiom "seven veils" with "of unreality" to evoke stacked layers of illusion
  - seven from Old English seofon (Proto-Germanic *sebun, from Proto-Indo-European *septm), literal sense “the number seven”
  - veil from Old French veil/veile, from Latin velum “sail, covering”; unreality = un- “not” + reality (via French réalité, Medieval Latin realitas, from Latin res “thing”)
- **history:**
  - the "seven veils" motif entered modern culture via Oscar Wilde’s Salome (1891) and Richard Strauss’s opera (1905), fixing the image of layered veils
  - the phrase appears in late 20th–21st century spiritual, psychological, and cultural criticism as a metaphor for pervasive illusions; it has no single canonical coinage
  - use of the number seven draws on long-standing symbolism of completeness, while “unreality” echoes philosophical discussions of illusion popularized in the 19th century (e.g., Western readings of the “veil of Maya”)
- **pronunciation:**
  - SEV-en VAYLZ of un-ree-AL-i-tee
