- **etymology:**
  - from Classical Syriac yaldā, meaning 'birth,' built on the Semitic root y‑l‑d 'to give birth'; adopted into Persian via early Christian communities

- **history:**

  - in medieval Persian literature (13th–15th c.), poets such as Hafez used shab‑e yalda as a metaphor for the darkest night before dawn
