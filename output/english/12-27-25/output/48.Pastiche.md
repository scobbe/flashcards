## Pastiche
---
- **definition:**
  - an artistic work that imitates the style of another creator or period, often as a respectful tribute
  - a mixture or medley of different styles or elements combined into one work
- **etymology:**
  - from French pastiche (18th c.), borrowed from Italian pasticcio meaning "medley" or "pie"
  - ultimately from Latin pasta "paste, dough," from Greek pastē "barley porridge; paste," referring to a mixture stuck together
- **history:**
  - entered English in the late 19th century (c. 1878) via French, first used in art and literary criticism
  - in 18th‑century opera, the Italian pasticcio named works assembled from numbers by different composers, shaping the later English sense
  - in the late 20th century, postmodern critics (e.g., Fredric Jameson, 1980s–1990s) used pastiche for style‑mixing without satire; the term spread across film, architecture, and design
