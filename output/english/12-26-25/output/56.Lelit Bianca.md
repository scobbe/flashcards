---
- **definition:**
  - a high-end Italian espresso machine model from Lelit, known for dual boilers and a manual flow-control paddle for precise brewing
- **etymology:**
  - bianca is Italian for 'white' (feminine), from Vulgar Latin 'blancus' meaning 'white, shining', ultimately from a Germanic root meaning 'bright/white'
  - lelit is a modern Italian brand coinage; it does not trace to a specific historical root and was likely created for trademark distinctiveness
