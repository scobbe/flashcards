## Yi jing
---
- **definition:**
  - an ancient Chinese classic (the “Book of Changes”) used for divination and philosophy, built around 64 hexagrams with attached texts
  - the oracle practice associated with the book, casting coins or yarrow stalks to obtain a reading and guidance
- **etymology:**
  - from Mandarin Yìjīng (易经): yì = change; jīng = classic/scripture; literally “Classic of Changes”
  - entered English via Wade–Giles romanization “I Ching” (earlier also “I King”); modern pinyin spells it “Yijing”
- **history:**
  - the core text (Zhouyi) arose in Western Zhou China (c. 1000–750 BCE); layered commentaries known as the Ten Wings were compiled from the Warring States to early Han (4th–2nd c. BCE)
  - it became one of the Five Classics and, in tradition, was linked to Confucius, evolving from a court divination manual into a cornerstone of cosmology and ethics
  - in English, James Legge published a translation in 1882; Richard Wilhelm’s 1924 German version and the 1950 Wilhelm–Baynes English edition—with Carl Jung’s foreword—popularized it in the West, especially from the 1950s–70s
- **pronunciation:**
  - yee-JING
