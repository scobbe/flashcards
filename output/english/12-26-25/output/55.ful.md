## Ful
---
- **definition:**
  - archaic spelling of “full”: filled; complete; entire
  - middle english adverb meaning “very,” used before adjectives or adverbs (e.g., “ful glad”)
- **etymology:**
  - from old english ful “full, filled,” from proto-germanic *fullaz “full,” ultimately from proto-indo-european *plē- “to be full, fill”
  - the adverbial use comes from using the adjective adverbially in old english; the form also underlies the derivational suffix -ful (“full of”) in later english
- **history:**
  - attested in old english (c. 9th century) and common through middle english; chaucer (c. 1380s) wrote phrases like “ful faire” and “ful manye”
  - during early modern english (1500s–1600s) print-era spelling settled on “full,” and the standalone form “ful” receded
  - the adverbial intensifier waned in the 1700s–1800s as “very” and similar modifiers rose; today it survives in archaic or poetic phrases like “full many a”
