## Makgeolli
---
- **definition:**
  - a traditional Korean, lightly sparkling, milky rice wine that is sweet-tart and low in alcohol
  - made by fermenting rice (sometimes other grains) with a natural starter and served fresh, often in bowls
- **etymology:**
  - from Korean 막걸리 (makgeolli): 막 (mak) “roughly; just; carelessly” + 거르다 (georeuda) “to strain/filter,” literally “roughly strained”
  - entered English via Korean romanization; also seen as makkoli/makgoli in older spellings
- **history:**
  - turbid rice wines were brewed in Korea for centuries; records from Goryeo (918–1392) and Joseon (1392–1910) note farmer’s rice liquors
  - known in official categories as takju (turbid rice wine); makgeolli became the popular name for the coarsely filtered, ready-to-drink style
  - rice-use bans (1965–1999) forced brewers to use substitutes; lifting the ban and a 2009–2012 “makgeolli boom” revitalized craft and global awareness
- **pronunciation:**
  - mahk-GUHL-lee
