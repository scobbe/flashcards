## Lymphatic System
---
- **definition:**
  - a network of vessels, nodes, and organs that carries lymph, returns excess tissue fluid to the bloodstream, and absorbs fats from the intestines
  - a core part of the immune system that filters pathogens and transports white blood cells
- **etymology:**
  - from Latin lympha “clear water; spring” (related to nymph) → New Latin lymphaticus “pertaining to lymph,” giving English lymphatic
  - system from Greek systēma (via Latin systema) meaning “an organized whole; a composite of parts”
  - formed in English as the adjective “lymphatic” + the noun “system” to label the body’s lymph-carrying network
- **history:**
  - 1620s–1650s: Gaspare Aselli (1622) described intestinal lacteals; Thomas Bartholin and Olaus Rudbeck (1652–53) mapped lymphatic vessels and articulated a body-wide network
  - by the 18th century the phrase appeared in English medical texts; 19th-century anatomy standardized “lymphatic system” in diagrams and teaching
  - late 19th–20th centuries expanded its role from fluid drainage to immunity (lymphocytes, nodes); in 2015 meningeal lymphatic vessels were confirmed, extending its known reach to the brain
- **pronunciation:**
  - lim-FAT-ik SIS-tem
