## Succotash
---

  - anglicized by English colonists in the 1700s, with the native term adapted to English spelling and sounds as succotash

  - attested in American English by 1751; colonists adopted the Indigenous dish rooted in the “Three Sisters” agriculture of corn, beans, and squash
  - became a New England and mid-Atlantic staple in the 1800s, often enriched with salt pork, cream, tomatoes, or peppers, and linked to harvest and Thanksgiving meals
  - remained popular during the Great Depression as an inexpensive, filling side; the exclamation “Sufferin’ succotash!” in 1940s–50s Looney Tunes kept the word culturally familiar
