## Fen
---
- **definition:**
  - a low, flat wetland with shallow, slow-moving water, often grassy and peaty
  - often plural 'the Fens': a flat, formerly marshy region of eastern England
- **etymology:**
  - from Old English fenn 'marsh; mud', inherited as a common noun
  - from Proto-Germanic *fanją 'marsh; mud', cognate with Old Norse fen, Dutch veen, and Old High German fenna
  - possibly ultimately from Proto-Indo-European root *pen- 'to be wet; to swell'; the modern English form continues the Old English noun unchanged
- **history:**
  - first recorded in Old English (c. 8th–11th centuries) in place-names and charters describing wet pasture and peat-cutting grounds
  - by the 17th century, 'the Fens' named the marshlands of eastern England; major drainage works led by Cornelius Vermuyden (1630s–1650s) reshaped the area
  - in the 19th–20th centuries, naturalists used the term more precisely in ecology, contrasting groundwater-fed fens with rain-fed bogs
- **pronunciation:**
