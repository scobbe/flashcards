  - a calque of Greek theia mania “god‑inspired frenzy,” from theos “god” + mania “madness, frenzy”

- **history:**
  - 4th c. BCE: Plato (Phaedrus, Ion) valorizes “divine madness” in prophecy, poetry, ritual ecstasy, and erotic love
  - 15th c.: Renaissance Platonists (e.g., Marsilio Ficino) revive the idea via Latin translations and commentaries, linking it to artistic inspiration
  - 18th–19th c.: the phrase spreads in English literary criticism; Romantics celebrate inspired “madness,” and 20th c. scholars apply it to altered religious or creative states
