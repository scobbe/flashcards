## Hanseatic League
---
- **definition:**
  - a medieval and early modern alliance of merchant guilds and port cities in northern Europe that coordinated trade and mutual defense
  - the network of Hanseatic towns and trading posts that managed commerce across the Baltic and North Sea region
- **etymology:**
  - hanseatic from Middle Low German hanse “band, troop; guild,” via Medieval Latin Hanseaticus “of the Hanse,” with the Latin-derived suffix -atic
  - league from Middle English via Old French ligue, from Italian lega, ultimately from Latin ligare “to bind”
  - the compound literally means “the guild-based alliance”
- **history:**
  - commonly traced to a 1241 pact between Lübeck and Hamburg; it expanded into a broader confederation by the late 13th century as northern European trade grew
  - at its height in the 14th–15th centuries, it dominated Baltic and North Sea commerce, operating kontors in London (the Steelyard), Bruges, Bergen, and Novgorod and securing privileges from rulers
  - declined in the 16th–17th centuries due to rising nation-states, Dutch and English competition, and shifting trade routes; the last general diet met in 1669, after which the league faded though member cities kept the “Hanseatic” identity
- **pronunciation:**
  - han-see-AT-ik leeg
