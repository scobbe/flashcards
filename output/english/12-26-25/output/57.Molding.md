## Molding
---
- **definition:**
  - a decorative strip or profile used to trim or finish edges on walls, ceilings, doors, or furniture
  - the process of shaping a material in a hollow form; also, an object produced by that process
  - the shaping or influencing of something abstract, such as character or opinion (figurative)
- **etymology:**
  - from mold/mould “hollow form for shaping,” via Middle English from Old French moule (also modle), from Latin modulus, diminutive of modus “measure; manner”
  - formed with the English suffix -ing, creating a noun of action or result: both “the act of shaping” and “a shaped strip/object”
  - unrelated to mold “fungus,” which goes back to Old English molde “soil; earth”
- **history:**
  - attested in English by the 1500s for the act of shaping; by the 1600s it referred to decorative architectural trim in carpentry and stonework (us: “molding,” uk: “moulding”)
  - 17th–18th‑century pattern books and treatises (e.g., Serlio in English, and Batty Langley in the 1730s) standardized common profiles like ovolo, cavetto, and ogee
  - in industry, the term broadened with metal casting and later plastics: John W. Hyatt patented an injection molding machine in 1872; mid‑20th‑century plastics made molding central to mass production
- **pronunciation:**
  - MOHL-ding
