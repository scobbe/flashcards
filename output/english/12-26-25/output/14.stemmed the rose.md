## Stemmed the rose
---
- **definition:**
  - past tense of a figurative phrase: an archaic, vulgar euphemism meaning had sexual intercourse with a woman (often implying defloration)
  - literal/rare: cut or trimmed the stem of a rose flower
- **etymology:**
  - english compound from stem (Old English stemn/stefn, “stalk, trunk”) + rose (via Old French rose from Latin rosa, “rose”)
  - the euphemism arises from long-standing floral symbolism: the rose as female beauty/virginity and the stem as a phallic image, likely reinforced by punning on flower anatomy (stamen)
  - formed in english through metaphorical extension of botanical terms to sexual imagery
- **history:**
  - in use by the 17th century in English bawdy verse and stage wit during the Elizabethan/Restoration taste for floral sexual metaphors
  - entered 18th–19th‑century slang lexicons (e.g., Grose’s Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue, 1785; later Farmer & Henley), marking it as coarse but recognizable slang
  - usage declined through the 20th century; today it is chiefly encountered in historical texts and studies of slang, read as archaic and ribald
