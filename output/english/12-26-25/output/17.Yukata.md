## Yukata
---
- **definition:**
  - a casual, unlined kimono-style robe, usually cotton, worn in summer or after bathing
  - a light robe provided at hot-spring inns or bathhouses, used as loungewear or festival attire
- **etymology:**
  - borrowed from Japanese yukata; earlier form yukatabira (湯帷子), from yu "hot water; bath" + katabira "under-robe"
  - later written as 浴衣, literally "bathing clothes" (浴 "to bathe" + 衣 "clothes")
- **history:**
  - originated in Japan’s Heian period (794–1185) as a linen yukatabira worn by court nobles after steam baths; by the Edo period (1603–1868) cotton versions spread to townspeople and public bathhouses
  - in the 20th century it became standard attire at onsen and ryokan and popular summer wear at festivals and fireworks; bright prints and synthetics expanded styles after World War II
  - the word entered English by the mid-20th century via travel and fashion writing, as Japanese tourism and cultural festivals familiarized the garment abroad
- **pronunciation:**
  - yoo-KAH-tah
