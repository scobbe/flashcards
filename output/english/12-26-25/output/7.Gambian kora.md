## Gambian kora
---
- **definition:**
  - a 21‑string West African harp‑lute, specifically as made and played in The Gambia
  - the Gambian musical tradition and repertoire performed on that instrument
- **etymology:**
  - “Gambian”: English demonym formed from the country name “Gambia” + the suffix -an/-ian; “Gambia” goes back to Portuguese “Gâmbia,” likely adapting a Mandinka name for the river (often cited as Kambaa/Kambra)
  - “kora”: from Mandinka (a Mande language) kora, the traditional name of the 21‑string harp‑lute, borrowed into English through West African contact and reportage
  - the compound simply joins the demonym with the instrument name to mark national origin/style
- **history:**
  - mandinka oral histories place the kora’s development in the Kaabu/Mande sphere by the 18th century, with jeli (griot) lineages in The Gambia sustaining courtly praise‑singing on the instrument
  - by the mid‑20th century the kora was documented in field recordings (1950s–60s), and “Gambian kora” emerged as a way to distinguish instruments and repertoires tied to The Gambia
  - gambian masters such as Alhaji Bai Konte (U.S. tours in 1973) and Foday Musa Suso (moved to the U.S. in 1977) popularized the kora globally, leading to concert, jazz, and fusion uses from the 1980s onward
- **pronunciation:**
  - GAM-bee-uhn KOR-uh
