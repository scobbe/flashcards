## Forró
---
- **definition:**
  - a lively music genre from northeastern Brazil, typically featuring accordion, zabumba drum, and triangle
  - a close partner dance performed to this music, marked by quick steps and spins
  - a dance party or festival event where this music and dance are the focus
- **etymology:**
  - from Brazilian Portuguese forró, likely a shortening of forrobodó, meaning “boisterous party” or “ruckus”
  - forrobodó is Brazilian slang attested by the late 19th century; its deeper origin is uncertain, and the acute accent in forró marks final-syllable stress
  - the popular claim that it comes from English “for all” is a modern folk etymology with no solid evidence
- **history:**
  - early 1900s: the term forrobodó (and later forró) denoted raucous parties; Chiquinha Gonzaga’s hit revue “Forrobodó” (1912) cemented the word in popular culture
  - 1940s–50s: Luiz Gonzaga popularized forró nationwide via radio and records, standardizing the accordion–zabumba–triangle trio; classics like “Asa Branca” (1947) defined the style
  - 1990s–present: new waves (forró universitário; later forró eletrônico) broadened its appeal from June festivals to global dance scenes; the term entered English usage via world‑music media in the late 20th century
- **pronunciation:**
