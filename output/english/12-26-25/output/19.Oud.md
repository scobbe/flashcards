## Oud
---
- **definition:**
  - a short‑necked, fretless, pear‑shaped lute used in Middle Eastern and North African music
  - a fragrant resinous wood (and its oil), also called agarwood, used in incense and perfumery
- **etymology:**
  - from Arabic al-'ud “the wood”; via medieval Romance forms (Spanish laúd, French luth) that yielded English lute; modern English reborrowed oud for the original instrument
  - in perfumery, from Arabic 'ud “agarwood, fragrant wood” (also spelled oudh or aoud), literally “wood,” referring to the scented heartwood of Aquilaria trees
- **history:**
  - as an instrument, it took shape in the early Islamic era (7th–8th c. CE) and entered Europe through al‑Andalus, influencing the medieval lute; the Arabic form oud became common in English in the late 20th century
  - culture bearers include the 9th‑century musician Ziryab in Córdoba and 20th‑century virtuosi like Farid al‑Atrash and Munir Bashir; late‑20th/early‑21st‑century artists such as Anouar Brahem and Naseer Shamma broadened its global reach
  - as a perfume term, oud/oudh appears in 19th‑century English trade and travel accounts; Western luxury perfumery embraced it in the 2000s (e.g., Oud Wood, 2007), prompting plantation cultivation after wild agarwood faced CITES controls
- **pronunciation:**
  - OOD
