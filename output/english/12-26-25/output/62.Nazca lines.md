## Nazca lines
---
- **definition:**
  - a vast set of ancient geoglyphs—long lines, shapes, and animal figures—etched across the desert of southern Peru
  - made by clearing dark stones to expose pale ground; most designs are best seen from the air
- **etymology:**
  - “nazca” is the Spanish name of a Peruvian valley and culture (also spelled “nasca”), taken from an indigenous place-name; the precise native origin is uncertain
  - “lines” comes through Middle English from Latin linea “linen thread,” from linum “flax,” later generalized to mean a narrow mark
  - the phrase is an English compound: the place-name “Nazca” plus the descriptive noun “lines”
- **history:**
  - created by the Nazca culture circa 200 BCE–600 CE during the Early Intermediate Period by removing surface pebbles to reveal lighter soil beneath
  - their full extent was recognized with 1920s–30s overflights; Toribio Mejía Xesspe reported them in 1927, Paul Kosok began detailed study in 1939, and María Reiche mapped and protected them for decades
  - the term spread in English in the mid-20th century; UNESCO inscribed the site in 1994; surveys in the 2010s–2020s using aerial imagery and drones have identified many new figures and refined theories about ritual and water-related purposes
- **pronunciation:**
  - NAZ-kah lines
