## Bánh cuốn / Bánh ướt
---
- **definition:**
  - a Vietnamese dish of thin steamed rice sheets rolled around fillings (often minced pork and wood ear mushroom) and served with herbs and fish sauce; known as bánh cuốn
  - the unfilled version, bánh ướt: soft steamed rice sheets served flat with toppings (such as Vietnamese pork sausage, grilled meats, herbs) and a dipping sauce
- **etymology:**
  - vietnamese bánh “cake; pastry; dumpling” + cuốn “rolled; wrapped” → literally “rolled cake”
  - vietnamese bánh “cake” + ướt “wet; moist” → literally “wet cake,” referring to the soft steamed sheet
  - formed by compounding native Vietnamese words; descriptive names rather than borrowings
- **history:**
  - originated in northern Vietnam (notably Hanoi); by the early 1900s it was a common street breakfast made by steaming rice batter on cloth over boiling water
  - bánh ướt spread and diversified in central and southern Vietnam, where flat sheets are topped with herbs, pork sausage, and grilled meats and served with dipping sauce
  - the Vietnamese names entered English-language menus and cookbooks after 1975 with the Vietnamese diaspora; by the 1990s–2000s they were common in diaspora restaurants
- **pronunciation:**
  - bahng KWOON / bahng UHT
