## Roman Curia
---
- **definition:**
  - the central administrative bodies of the Holy See that assist the pope in governing the Catholic Church
  - by extension, the papal government in Rome as a whole, including its departments (dicasteries, tribunals, and offices)
- **etymology:**
  - from Medieval Latin Curia Romana, literally Roman court or council; curia in classical Latin meant an assembly, senate-house, or court
  - roman from Latin Romanus (of Rome), from Roma (Rome)
  - entered English via Church Latin; the noun phrase pairs the adjective roman with curia to name the papal administration
- **history:**
  - medieval use of curia for the papal court was established by the 12th–13th centuries; centralization grew during the Avignon Papacy (1309–1377)
  - pope sixtus v reorganized the curia in 1588 (Immensa Aeterni Dei), creating stable congregations; later major reforms included pius x (Sapienti Consilio, 1908) and paul vi (Regimini Ecclesiae Universae, 1967) after Vatican II
  - john paul ii issued Pastor Bonus (1988) and pope francis promulgated Praedicate Evangelium (2022), further restructuring its departments; the English phrase Roman Curia appears in sources by the 17th century
