## Citron
---
- **definition:**
  - a large, very fragrant citrus fruit (Citrus medica) with a thick, bumpy rind and little pulp
  - the candied peel of the citron, used in fruitcakes and other baked goods
  - a vivid yellow‑green color, named after the fruit
- **etymology:**
  - from Old French "citron" meaning "lemon," borrowed into Middle English
  - from Latin "citrus" "citron tree," possibly related to Greek "kedros" "cedar" (for the aromatic scent/wood)
  - the English sense later narrowed to the specific fruit Citrus medica, distinct from the lemon
- **history:**
  - first attested in English in the late 1200s, initially often referring to lemons; by the 15th–16th centuries it settled on the distinct fruit now called "citron"
  - cultivated around the Mediterranean since classical antiquity; candied citron became a staple of European confectionery by the Renaissance with expanding sugar trade
  - prominent in Jewish ritual as the etrog during Sukkot; English texts in the 17th–18th centuries use "citron" in that context; the color sense emerges in the 19th century in fashion and design
- **pronunciation:**
  - SIT-ruhn
