  - the standard English romanized form of this artist’s Chinese name (also seen as “Chi Pai-shih” in older sources)
- **etymology:**
  - from Mandarin Chinese Qí Báishí (齐白石): Qí is the family name; Báishí means “white stone” (白 ‘white’ + 石 ‘stone’)
  - the English form follows Hanyu Pinyin romanization; earlier Wade–Giles romanized it as “Chi Pai-shih”
  - the element Báishí is an art name (hao) the painter adopted, later used widely as his given name in public life
- **history:**
  - born in 1864 in Hunan; trained as a carpenter, then turned to painting; traveled widely in the early 1900s and settled in Beijing in 1917 as his reputation grew during Republican China
  - recognized in the People’s Republic era; awarded the International Peace Prize in 1955; died in 1957, by then considered a national master
  - posthumously, his works set major auction records (notably in 2011 and 2017), and English usage shifted from “Chi Pai-shih” to “Qi Baishi” as pinyin became standard (adopted in China in 1958; widespread internationally by the 1970s)
