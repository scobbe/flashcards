## Parapet vs rampart
---
- **definition:**
  - parapet: a low protective wall at the edge of a roof, balcony, or bridge; in fortifications, the shield at the top of a wall or rampart
  - rampart: a broad defensive embankment or wall surrounding a fort or town, often topped by a parapet
- **etymology:**
  - from italian parapetto via french parapet: para- (from parare, “to ward off”) + petto (“breast, chest,” from latin pectus) — literally “chest-high defense”
  - from middle french rempart, from remparer (“to fortify, protect again”), re- (“again”) + parer (“to ward off”)
  - both words trace back to romance roots meaning “to ward off/protect,” reflecting their defensive function
- **history:**
  - late 1500s: both terms enter English amid the rise of gunpowder warfare and the trace italienne (star-fort) style
  - 1600s–1700s: under engineers like Vauban (1633–1707), ramparts become massive earthworks absorbing cannon fire, with parapets standardized for muskets and artillery embrasures
  - 1800s onward: parapet broadens in civilian use for low walls on roofs and bridges; rampart remains primarily military or figurative for strong defenses
- **pronunciation:**
  - PAIR-uh-pet vs RAM-part
