## Slat
---
- **definition:**
  - a long, narrow, flat strip of wood, metal, or plastic used in fences, furniture, or window blinds
  - in aviation, a movable panel on the front edge of a wing that extends to increase lift at low speeds
  - to equip, arrange, or cover with slats
- **etymology:**
  - from Middle English slatte “thin strip, splinter,” likely from Old French esclat “splinter, fragment” (modern French éclat)
  - from the verb esclater “to split, shatter,” literally “to break into pieces,” describing how slats are made by splitting material
  - possibly reinforced by Germanic roots meaning “to slit/tear” (compare Old Norse slíta “to tear,” Old High German slīzan “to slit”)
- **history:**
  - first recorded in English in the late 14th century for a thin strip used in building and joinery, amid the rise of medieval craft guilds
  - by the 18th–19th centuries, “slat” became common for bed bases and Venetian blinds as mass-produced household goods spread during the Industrial Revolution
  - in the 1910s–1920s, “leading-edge slat” entered aviation after patents by Gustav Lachmann (1918) and Handley Page (1919), extending the term to aircraft control surfaces
- **pronunciation:**
  - SLAT
