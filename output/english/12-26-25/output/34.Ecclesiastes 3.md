## Ecclesiastes 3
---
- **definition:**
  - the third chapter of the biblical book Ecclesiastes, famous for the “a time to…” poem about life’s seasons
  - by allusion, a reference to the idea that events have their appointed, contrasting times
- **etymology:**
  - from Latin Ecclesiastes, via Greek Ekklesiastes ‘preacher/assembler,’ the Septuagint title for Hebrew Qoheleth ‘assembler/teacher’
  - Ecclesiastes from Greek ekklesia ‘assembly’ (ek- ‘out’ + kalein ‘to call’); the “3” is the chapter numeral in standard biblical division
- **history:**
  - composed in Hebrew likely in the Hellenistic period (c. 3rd–2nd century BCE); traditionally ascribed to Solomon though authorship is debated
  - entered English in Wycliffe’s Bible (c. 1382), with influential renderings by Tyndale (1530s) and the King James Version (1611), which fixed the cadence of 3:1–8
  - its “a time to…” lines became a modern cultural touchstone, notably in Pete Seeger’s song Turn! Turn! Turn! (1950s) and The Byrds’ 1965 hit
- **pronunciation:**
  - ih-klee-zee-AS-teez three
