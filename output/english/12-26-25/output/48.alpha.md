  - the first letter of the Greek alphabet; by extension, something that is first, primary, or highest in rank
  - a dominant individual in a group (especially animals), or informally, a top-ranking, assertive person
  - in finance, the extra return a strategy earns beyond the market benchmark, attributed to skill
- **origin:**
  - from Greek alpha, via Latin, ultimately from Phoenician aleph meaning "ox"; the Greeks adapted the letter name and shape
  - used since ancient times to label the first or most important item; paired with omega to mean "the beginning and the end" in early Christian usage
  - in modern finance, alpha became the symbol for excess return in mid-20th-century models, extending the letter's "first/leading" sense
