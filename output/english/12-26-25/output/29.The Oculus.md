## The Oculus
---
- **definition:**
  - the dramatic white, winged main hall and landmark building of the World Trade Center Transportation Hub in lower Manhattan, designed by Santiago Calatrava
  - by extension, the transit-and-retail complex centered on that hall, opened to the public in 2016
- **etymology:**
  - from Latin oculus meaning "eye"; in classical architecture an oculus is a circular opening at the crown of a dome
  - adopted into English architectural vocabulary via Latin/Italian usage (early modern period), then applied as a proper name to the WTC hub for its eye-like skylight
- **history:**
  - conceived in the early 2000s during the post–September 11 rebuilding of lower Manhattan; Calatrava’s dove-like design was unveiled in 2004
  - built amid delays and overruns from roughly 2008 to 2016; the main hall (the Oculus) opened March 3, 2016, with the Westfield retail concourse opening in August 2016
  - its movable ridge skylight—intended to create a "Way of Light" each September 11 around 10:28 a.m.—has opened on some anniversaries as a commemorative gesture
- **pronunciation:**
  - thee OCK-yuh-luss
