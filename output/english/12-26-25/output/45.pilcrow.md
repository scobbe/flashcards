## Pilcrow
---
- **definition:**
  - the paragraph mark (¶), used to show a new paragraph or a paragraph break
  - in proofreading/editing, a mark indicating where a new paragraph should begin
  - in word processors, the icon that toggles hidden formatting symbols on/off
- **etymology:**
  - ultimately from Greek paragraphos, literally “written beside” (para “beside” + graphein “write”), via Latin paragraphus and Old French paragraphe
  - reshaped in Middle English into pilcrow (attested by the 1440s) through alteration and metanalysis, influenced by the P-shaped paragraph mark
- **history:**
  - in classical Greece (by the 4th century BCE), a paragraphos mark in the margin signaled section breaks; medieval scribes later used a red capitulum (a C-like sign) that evolved into ¶
  - early printers in the 15th–16th centuries used pilcrows to show paragraph breaks and as placeholders for rubrication; the English word is recorded by the 1440s
  - from the 18th–19th centuries, indentation and spacing displaced the sign in ordinary print; in the late 20th century it became the standard “show formatting” icon in software
- **pronunciation:**
  - PIL-kroh
