  - a spicy Vietnamese noodle soup from the city of Huế, with rice vermicelli in a lemongrass, chili, and shrimp-paste broth, typically with beef and often pork
  - the menu name for this Huế-style soup, commonly written without diacritics as "bun bo Hue" in English
- **etymology:**
  - vietnamese compound: "bún" (rice vermicelli) + "bò" (beef) + "Huế" (the city’s name), literally "Huế beef noodles"
  - formed by adding the place-name to mark the Huế style, distinguishing it from other regional bún bò variants
  - borrowed into english in the late 20th century; diacritics are often dropped, yielding "bun bo Hue"

  - spread across Vietnam through the 20th century, standing out from northern phở with a spicier, lemongrass-forward broth
  - entered english-speaking dining after the 1975 Vietnamese diaspora; by the 1990s it appeared on U.S. menus, and in the 2000s–2010s it gained wider fame through food media, notably praise from Anthony Bourdain
