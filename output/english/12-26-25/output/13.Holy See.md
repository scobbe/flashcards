  - the episcopal seat (see) of the Bishop of Rome
- **etymology:**
  - an English calque of Church Latin sancta sedes, literally holy seat; also related to sedes apostolica meaning apostolic see
  - see (ecclesiastical noun) comes via Old French se from Latin sedes meaning seat or chair
  - holy continues Old English halig meaning sacred, a common translation of Latin sanctus in church usage
- **history:**
  - attested in English by the 14th century, reflecting medieval Latin usage for the Roman bishop’s authority and seat
  - as the papacy gained and later lost the Papal States (c. 754–1870), the term came to denote the papal government itself; the 1929 Lateran Treaty affirmed its sovereignty and created Vatican City
