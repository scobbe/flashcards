## Viviperous
---
- **definition:**
  - producing live young rather than laying eggs (as in mammals and some reptiles and fish)
  - in botany, producing plantlets or seeds that begin to grow while still attached to the parent plant
- **etymology:**
  - from Latin viviparus, meaning "bearing live young" (vivus "alive" + parere "to bring forth"), adopted into English with the -ous ending
  - the element -parous in scientific terms comes from Latin -parus, from parere, meaning "to produce" or "to give birth"
  - related formation viviparity follows the same Latin roots to name the reproductive mode
- **history:**
  - first recorded in English in the mid-17th century, when early modern naturalists were classifying animals by reproductive strategy
  - saw wider use in 18th-century taxonomy (including Linnaean systems) to contrast with oviparous species
  - by the 19th century it was applied in botany to plants like mangroves and some grasses that germinate seeds on the parent plant
- **pronunciation:**
  - vih-VIP-uh-rus
