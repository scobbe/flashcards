---
- **definition:**

- **etymology:**

  - gordo is traditionally traced to Latin gurdus “dull, heavy; thick,” with the sense shifting to “fat” in Romance languages
  - formed with Spanish gendered endings: masculine gordito (-o) vs. feminine gordita (-a)
- **history:**
  - used across Latin America as an affectionate nickname; appears in English-language reporting and fiction by the mid–late 20th century alongside increased U.S. exposure to Spanish
