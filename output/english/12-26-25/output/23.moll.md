## Moll
---
- **definition:**
  - a gangster's girlfriend or female companion (especially in old crime slang)
  - a woman regarded as sexually promiscuous; in Australia/New Zealand slang, an insulting term for a woman
  - archaic: a prostitute or the female associate of a thief
- **etymology:**
  - from moll/molly, a pet form of the given name Mary < Latin Maria < Greek Maria < Hebrew Miryam (literal meaning uncertain)
  - developed in English thieves' cant where moll meant "woman, prostitute"; formed by shortening a personal name and applying it generically
  - not related to Latin mollis "soft"; the similarity is coincidental
- **history:**
  - first attested in English criminal cant in the 1600s meaning "prostitute" or "thief's woman," amid the growth of London’s urban underworld
  - linked to notorious figures and works such as Mary Frith (“Moll Cutpurse,” c. 1584–1659) and Defoe’s novel Moll Flanders (1722), which cemented the name’s shady associations
  - in U.S. Prohibition-era slang (1920s–30s), gun moll became common for a gangster’s girlfriend; in Australia/New Zealand from the mid-1900s, moll broadened into a general insult
- **pronunciation:**
  - MAWL
