## Movado
---
- **definition:**
  - a Swiss watchmaker and brand, often recognized by its minimalist “Museum” dial with a single dot at 12

- **etymology:**
  - from Esperanto “movado,” meaning “movement” (ongoing motion)
  - built from the verb “movi” (to move) + the suffix “-ado” (continuous action or process)
  - adopted as the company name in 1905 to evoke both watch movement and modern dynamism
- **history:**
  - founded in 1881 in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, by Achille Ditesheim; renamed Movado in 1905 amid a period of brand modernization in Swiss watchmaking
  - in 1947 designer Nathan George Horwitt created the single-dot dial; in 1960 the Museum of Modern Art added it to its collection, shaping Movado’s modernist identity
  - acquired by North American Watch Company in 1983; in the early 1990s the parent firm became Movado Group, expanding globally while promoting the Museum Watch as its signature
