## Theremin
---
- **definition:**
  - an electronic musical instrument played without touch, using hand movements near two antennas to control pitch and volume
- **etymology:**
  - from the surname of Russian inventor Léon Theremin (born Lev Termen); the instrument name is an eponym of its creator
  - also known early on as thereminvox/termenvox, combining the inventor’s name with Latin vox “voice”
  - another early name, etherphone, comes from Greek aither “upper air” + phōnē “sound/voice,” describing sound made through the air without contact
- **history:**
  - first demonstrated in 1920 in Petrograd by Léon Theremin; public tours in the early 1920s brought the name into English
  - commercialized in the U.S. by RCA in 1929, though sales suffered during the Great Depression; virtuoso Clara Rockmore refined concert technique in the 1930s–40s
  - its eerie timbre became a hallmark of 1940s–50s film and sci‑fi scores (e.g., Spellbound, The Day the Earth Stood Still); interest revived in the 1990s with Moog-built models and the 1993 documentary Theremin: An Electronic Odyssey
- **pronunciation:**
