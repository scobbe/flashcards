- **definition:**
  - lasting for a very short time; brief or fleeting
  - in nature/biology, living or existing only briefly (e.g., a plant, insect, or stream that appears for a short period)
  - intended to be used or enjoyed only for a short time; not meant to be permanent
- **etymology:**
  - from Greek "ephēmeros" meaning "lasting for a day," from "epi" (upon) + "hēmera" (day)

  - formed in English as an adjective denoting short duration, reflecting the original one‑day sense
- **history:**
  - first recorded in English in the 1570s describing one‑day phenomena, especially fevers in medical writing
  - by the 1630s it broadened to mean "short-lived" in general, used by naturalists for mayflies and by writers for transient things
  - in the 20th–21st centuries it became common in art and technology for works or content designed to disappear quickly (e.g., ephemeral art, social media stories)
