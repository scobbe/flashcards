## Serendipity
---
- **definition:**
  - the unexpected finding of something valuable or pleasant while not actively looking for it
  - a knack for noticing and making good use of lucky, accidental discoveries
- **etymology:**
  - coined in English by Horace Walpole (1754) from Serendip + the noun-forming suffix -ity
  - serendip is the medieval Arabic/Persian name for Sri Lanka (Arabic Sarandīb, Persian Sarandīp)
  - ultimately from Sanskrit Siṃhaladvīpa: Siṃhala “Sinhala; lion people” + dvīpa “island”
- **history:**
  - coined in 1754 by Horace Walpole in a letter to Horace Mann, inspired by the tale “The Three Princes of Serendip,” whose heroes made lucky finds through sagacity
  - used rarely in the 18th–19th centuries; gained prominence in the 20th century to describe scientific chance discoveries (e.g., Fleming’s 1928 penicillin) and was analyzed by sociologist Robert K. Merton in the 1940s–1950s
  - by the late 20th–21st century it spread into everyday speech, business, and pop culture while retaining the idea of fortunate, unintended discovery
