## Serendipity
---
- **definition:**
  - the unexpected finding of something valuable or pleasant while not actively looking for it
  - a knack for noticing and making good use of lucky, accidental discoveries
- **etymology:**
  - coined in English by Horace Walpole (1754) from Serendip + the noun-forming suffix -ity
  - serendip is the medieval Arabic/Persian name for Sri Lanka (Arabic Sarandīb, Persian Sarandīp)
  - ultimately from Sanskrit Siṃhaladvīpa: Siṃhala “Sinhala; lion people” + dvīpa “island”
- **history:**
  - coined in 1754 by Horace Walpole in a letter to Horace Mann, inspired by the tale “The Three Princes of Serendip,” whose heroes made lucky finds through sagacity
  - used rarely in the 18th–19th centuries; gained prominence in the 20th century to describe scientific chance discoveries (e.g., Fleming’s 1928 penicillin) and was analyzed by sociologist Robert K. Merton in the 1940s–1950s
  - by the late 20th–21st century it spread into everyday speech, business, and pop culture while retaining the idea of fortunate, unintended discovery

- **definition:**
  - vietnamese dishes made from steamed rice batter sheets: bánh cuốn are thin rolled rice crêpes with a savory filling; bánh ướt are plain “wet” sheets served with toppings and dipping sauce
  - in english, the names can refer to the prepared dish or to the rice sheets themselves, depending on context
- **etymology:**
  - vietnamese bánh “cake; flour-based food” + cuốn “rolled” → “rolled cake”; bánh + ướt “wet” → “wet cake”
  - written in the vietnamese quốc ngữ romanization with tone and vowel diacritics; often shown in english without marks as “banh cuon” and “banh uot”
  - native vietnamese compounds formed by modifying the general noun bánh with descriptive words
- **history:**
  - rooted in northern vietnamese cuisine, especially hanoi’s Thanh Trì area, where delicate rice sheets were a noted breakfast street food by the 20th century
  - entered english-language print and restaurant menus in the late 20th century, spreading with the vietnamese diaspora after 1975 and the global rise of vietnamese dining
  - usage reflects regional practice: the north favors filled bánh cuốn, the south popularized unfilled bánh ướt; english menus sometimes blend or gloss them as “steamed rice rolls/sheets”

  - bahn KWOON / bahn UHT
