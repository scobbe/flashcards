---
- **pinyin:** de/dé/děi
- **definition:** structural particle; to get, obtain; must, have to
- **components:**

    - dé
    - ancient phonetic graph
  - 旦

- **etymology:**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** semantic: 彳 (chì, "step") + phonetic: 㝵 (dé, "ancient phonetic graph").
  - **interpretation:** Left-side 彳 suggests movement or reaching a place, pointing to the idea of arriving at or attaining something. The right-side 㝵 provides the sound dé, with its lower 寸 hinting at a hand/action nuance, reinforcing the sense of acquisition. From the core idea of reaching/attaining comes both the verb "to get/obtain" and its grammatical use marking how well or to what extent an action is achieved.

### 彳
- **breadcrumbs:** 得
- **pinyin:** chì
- **definition:** step; small steps
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** ideogram
  - **description:** Simple indicative showing a small, left-foot step.
  - **interpretation:** Depicts the motion of moving the left foot forward in short, deliberate steps, hence the sense of 'step; small steps.' Often contrasted with 亍 (chù, "right step"), the pair evoking a slow, alternating walk.
### 㝵
- **breadcrumbs:** 得
- **pinyin:** dé
- **definition:** ancient phonetic graph
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** ideogram
  - **description:** Indicative phonetic sign; no reliable internal decomposition attested.
  - **interpretation:** Used historically as a conventional mark to indicate pronunciation in early texts, not to depict an object or combine semantic and phonetic parts. Its shape functions as a fixed symbol for sound and does not transparently break down into meaningful components.
### 旦
- **breadcrumbs:** 得
- **pinyin:** dàn
- **definition:** dawn; daybreak
- **components:**
  - 日
    - rì
    - sun; day
  - 一
    - yī
    - one; a line (ground/horizon)
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** ideogrammic compound
  - **description:** semantic: 日 (rì, "sun; day") + semantic: 一 (yī, "ground/horizon").
  - **interpretation:** Shows the sun sitting on the horizon, indicating the moment of daybreak. By combining the sun with a horizon line, it conveys dawn and the start of a new day.
### 日
- **breadcrumbs:** 得 → 旦
- **pinyin:** rì
- **definition:** sun; day
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** Pictograph depicting the sun (originally a circle with a central dot).
  - **interpretation:** Draws the image of the sun’s bright disk, once shown as a circle with a dot or a horizontal stroke inside. By association it came to mean “day,” as days are counted by the sun’s daily rise and set.
### 一
- **breadcrumbs:** 得 → 旦
- **pinyin:** yī
- **definition:** one; a line (ground/horizon)
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** ideogram
  - **description:** indicative: a single horizontal stroke representing the quantity one and, by extension, a line/horizon.
  - **interpretation:** A single line visually equals the count of one, so the meaning is immediate and self-evident. Because it is literally a straight line, it naturally evokes the ground or horizon, yielding the sense of a line.
### 寸
- **breadcrumbs:** 得
- **pinyin:** cùn
- **definition:** inch; hand/measure
- **components:**
  - 又
    - yòu
    - right hand
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** ideogram
  - **description:** indicative: 又 (yòu, "right hand") + a small mark indicating the wrist/pulse measure.
  - **interpretation:** Shows a hand with a short stroke marking the point at the wrist where one measures, conveying a small unit based on the hand. It later generalized to the unit "inch" and often serves as a hand/measurement semantic in compounds.
### 又
- **breadcrumbs:** 得 → 寸
- **pinyin:** yòu
- **definition:** right hand
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** Pictograph of a right hand; no phonetic component.
  - **interpretation:** Draws a stylized right hand with a bent wrist/thumb, representing the concept of the right hand. Over time it also developed extended uses (like "again"), but the original picture is of a hand.
