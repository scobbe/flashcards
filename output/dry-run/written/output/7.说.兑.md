- **traditional:** 兌
- **simplified:** 兑
- **pronunciation:** duì
- **definition:** 
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 兑(兌)付 (duìfù, "disburse payment")
  - 兑(兌)换(換) (duìhuàn, "currency exchange")
  - 兑(兌)奖(獎) (duìjiǎng, "redeem a prize")
  - 兑(兌)现(現) (duìxiàn, "honor a promise")
- **etymology (兌):**
  - **type:** ideogrammic compound
  - **description:** ideogrammic: 八 (bā, "breath") + 口 (kǒu, "mouth") + 人 (rén, "person") → original character of 说(說) (shuō, "to speak").
  - **interpretation:** Combining 八 (bā, "breath") above 口 (kǒu, "mouth") with 人 (rén, "person") depicts someone speaking, so it originally wrote 说(說) (shuō, "to speak"). Some scholars read 八 as smile lines or division of the mouth, linking it to 悦(悅) (yuè, "pleased"). Later, the graph developed distinct senses such as “to exchange,” while the original speaking/pleasure imagery was no longer central.
