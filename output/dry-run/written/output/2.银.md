## silver
---
- **traditional:** 銀
- **simplified:** 银
- **pronunciation:** yín

- **etymology (銀):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** semantic: 金 (jīn, "metal") + phonetic: 艮 (gèn, "stopping") → 银(銀) (yín, "silver").
  - **interpretation:** The character combines 金 as the semantic determinative indicating a metal with 艮 as the phonetic element approximating the historical pronunciation leading to modern yín. The metal determinative directly fits the core meaning ‘silver’, and the term extended to money and currency because silver was historically used as a medium of exchange.

    - 金 (jīn, "metal")
    - 艮 (gèn, "stopping")
  - **reference:** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%8A%80
  - **simplification rule (银):** Left component 金 was simplified to the abbreviated radical 钅 while retaining the phonetic 艮 unchanged, following standard radical simplification conventions.
