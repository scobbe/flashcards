  - **description:** pictogram: depiction of two metal ingots → phonetic: 膂 (lǚ, "spine") → semantic extension to "music notes".
  - **interpretation:** It originally depicts two metal ingots, then was borrowed for the sound lǚ to write 膂 “spine”, later extended to denote the music-note series. Shuowen alternatively interprets the picture as two vertebrae. The phonetic loan explains why the same graph came to denote these senses and persists today as a surname and musical term.
