- **traditional:** 寸
- **simplified:** 寸
- **pronunciation:** cùn
- **definition:** inch
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 寸土寸金 (cùn tǔ cùn jīn, "land is precious")
  - 尺寸 (chǐ cùn, "size and dimensions")
  - 分寸 (fēn cùn, "sense of propriety")
  - 英寸 (yīng cùn, "imperial inch")
- **etymology (寸):**
  - **type:** ideogram → loan character
  - **description:** ideogram: 手 (shǒu, "hand") with a short stroke marking the wrist pulse point → loan: 尊 (zūn, "esteem") borrowed to write the unit of length.
  - **interpretation:** It first depicts a mark on the hand at the pulse point, a specific spot used for measuring along the forearm. Later, some analyses treat the 'inch' meaning as a loan via 尊, while others (e.g., Shuowen) derive it from the measured distance from wrist to that point; both explain the measurement sense in modern use.
