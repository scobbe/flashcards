---

- **etymology (說):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** phono-semantic: semantic: 言 (yán, "speech") + phonetic: 兑(兌) (duì, "exchange") → "to speak" meaning.
  - **interpretation:** Formed as a phono-semantic compound: 言 (yán, "speech") is the semantic determinative indicating speech, while 兑(兌) (duì, "exchange") supplies the sound. This matches modern senses related to speaking and explaining. Some sources relate the word family to a root meaning "to loosen," while others compare a Proto‑Sino‑Tibetan root "to speak," the latter fitting the semantics better.
  - **component characters:**
    - 言
    - 兑
    - 兌
  - **reference:** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%AA%AA
  - **simplification rule (说):** Component reduction and regularization: the speech radical 訁 was simplified to 讠, and the standardized form follows the variant 説 with 兑 as the phonetic, yielding 说.
