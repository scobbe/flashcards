  - **interpretation:** Combining 入 and 一 conveys things entering toward a single line, evoking the idea of converging or gathering, which aligns with its relation to 集. Alternatively, some interpret it as an inverted 口 combined with an early form of 今, depicting an open mouth; under that view, the connection to ‘gather’ would be a later association.
