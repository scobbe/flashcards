  - **interpretation:** The character combines 言 as a semantic determinative for speech with 𠯑 as a phonetic element indicating the pronunciation. Although the right side resembles 舌, the source notes it is historically 𠯑 and not related to 舌, aligning the meaning with speaking and words.

  - **simplification rule (话):** The traditional left component 言 was simplified to the abbreviated radical 讠, with overall stroke reduction and graphic regularization to yield 话.
