  - **interpretation:** The left component 言 supplies the semantic domain of speech and words, matching the modern meanings. The right component functions as the phonetic, indicating the reading huà; sources note the historical phonetic was 𠯑 and not actually the tongue, with the form later regularized to resemble 舌.
  - **component characters:**
    - 言
    - 舌
  - **reference:** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%A9%B1
  - **simplification rule (话):** 话 simplifies 話 by replacing 言 with the abbreviated radical 讠, reducing strokes while keeping the right-side component; a standard component replacement and stroke reduction.
