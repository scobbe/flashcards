  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:**
    - phono-semantic compound: semantic: 言 (yán, "word") + phonetic: 𠯑 (guō, "phonetic sign")
  - **interpretation:** The character combines 言 as a semantic determinative for speech with 𠯑 as a phonetic element indicating the pronunciation. Although the right side resembles 舌, the source notes it is historically 𠯑 and not related to 舌, aligning the meaning with speaking and words.
