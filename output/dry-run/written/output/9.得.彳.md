  - 彳字旁 (chì zì páng, "left-side radical")
  - 彳亍而行 (chì chù ér xíng, "pace along slowly")
- **etymology (彳):**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** pictogram of 行 (xíng, "street intersection") → graphic extraction of the left-side form as 彳 (chì, "step").
  - **interpretation:** It depicts a street intersection from above; the left portion was abstracted as a standalone form to denote a step or the left step. This abstraction became a semantic marker for walking or movement, aligning with the character’s modern sense of “step.”
