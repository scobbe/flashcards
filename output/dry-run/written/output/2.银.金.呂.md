- **traditional:** 呂
- **simplified:** 呂
- **pronunciation:** lǚ
- **definition:** 
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 吕(呂)剧(劇) (lǚ jù, "Lü opera")
  - 吕(呂)梁 (lǚ liáng, "Lüliang (city)")
  - 吕(呂)氏春秋 (lǚ shì chūn qiū, "Master Lü's Spring and Autumn")
  - 吕(呂)洞宾(賓) (lǚ dòng bīn, "Lü Dongbin")
- **etymology (呂):**
  - **type:** pictogram → phonetic loan
  - **description:** pictogram of 铝(鋁) (lǚ, "ingot") → phonetic loan: 吕(呂) (lǚ, "music notes") and 膂 (lǚ, "spine").
  - **interpretation:** It depicts two metal ingots. The graph was later borrowed for its sound to write the words for the even-numbered pitch-pipes/notes and for the spine, so the modern meanings come from phonetic loan rather than the original metal sense. Shuowen instead explained it as two vertebrae.
