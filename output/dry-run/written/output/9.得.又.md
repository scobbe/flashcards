    - pictogram: depiction of a right hand
  - **interpretation:** It depicts a right hand, and historically also served as the original graph for 右 (yòu, "right"). The modern adverbial sense is not from the hand pictograph but is an adverbial derivation of 有 (yǒu, "have; there is"), which explains its function marking repetition or addition in contemporary usage.
