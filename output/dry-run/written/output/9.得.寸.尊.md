- **etymology (尊):**
  - **type:** ideogrammic compound
  - **description:** ideogrammic: 酋 (qiú, "wine") + 寸 (cùn, "hand").
  - **interpretation:** The graph combines 酋 “wine” and 寸 “hand” to depict a hand presenting wine as an offering. This ceremonial offering conveys respect and veneration, aligning with the modern senses of honoring and respecting; the “ritual vessel” sense comes from its use in ceremonies. Some analyses of the small seal script instead read it as 酋 with 廾 “two hands” offering wine.
