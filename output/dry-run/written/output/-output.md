  - **type:** phono-semantic compound

  - **interpretation:** The character combines 金 as the semantic determinative indicating a metal with 艮 as the phonetic element approximating the historical pronunciation leading to modern yín. The metal determinative directly fits the core meaning ‘silver’, and the term extended to money and currency because silver was historically used as a medium of exchange.

  - **interpretation:** 亼 (jí, "open mouth") serves as the phonetic, reflecting an OC reading close to jīn. 士 (shì, "ritual axe") and 吕(呂) (lǚ, "two blocks of metal") supply the semantic field of metal, matching the modern senses of metal and gold. Shuowen’s alternative view sees metal in earth, but early forms lack earth; the meaning developed from “copper” to “metals” and later “gold.”

Alternatively, some interpret it as an inverted 口 combined with an early form of 今, depicting an open mouth; under that view, the connection to ‘gather’ would be a later association.

- **etymology (呂):**
  - **type:** pictogram → phonetic loan
  - **description:** pictogram: depiction of two metal ingots → phonetic: 膂 (lǚ, "spine") → semantic extension to "music notes".
  - **interpretation:** It originally depicts two metal ingots, then was borrowed for the sound lǚ to write 膂 “spine”, later extended to denote the music-note series. Shuowen alternatively interprets the picture as two vertebrae. The phonetic loan explains why the same graph came to denote these senses and persists today as a surname and musical term.

  - **interpretation:** It depicts two metal ingots.
