    - phono-semantic: semantic: 言 (yán, "speech") + phonetic: 兑(兌) (duì, "exchange") →

  - **interpretation:** Formed as a phono-semantic compound: 言 (yán, "speech") is the semantic determinative indicating speech, while 兑(兌) (duì, "exchange") supplies the sound. This matches modern senses related to speaking and explaining. Some sources relate the word family to a root meaning "to loosen," while others compare a Proto‑Sino‑Tibetan root "to speak," the latter fitting the semantics better.
