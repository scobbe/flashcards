---
- **traditional:** 得
- **simplified:** 得
- **pronunciation:** de/dé/děi
- **definition:** (1) structural particle (verb complements); (2) to get, obtain; (3) must, have to
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 做得好 (zuò de hǎo, "do well")
  - 得到 (dédào, "to obtain")
  - 得病 (débìng, "fall ill")
  - 得体(體) (détǐ, "socially appropriate")
- **etymology (得):**
  - **type:** ideogrammic compound
  - **description:** ideogrammic: 贝(貝) (bèi, "cowry") + 又 (yòu, "hand") → semantic: 彳 (chì, "step") added to show picking up on the road → Qin: 又 gained a horizontal stroke to become 寸 (cùn, "inch") → clerical: 贝(貝) simplified to 目 (mù, "eye") → clerical: 目 mutated into 旦 (dàn, "dawn"), which the regular script inherited.
  - **interpretation:** It depicts a hand picking up a cowry shell, indicating acquiring valuables, hence the sense ‘to obtain’. The added 彳 locates the action on the road, while later substitutions (又 → 寸; 贝 → 目 → 旦) are script conventions that did not change the meaning. This concrete sense underlies modern uses and extensions into grammatical functions.
