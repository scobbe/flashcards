### de/dé/děi
---
- **definition:** structural particle; to get, obtain; must, have to
- **pinyin:** de/dé/děi
- **components:**
  - 彳

### 得 → 彳
- **definition:** step; to walk
- **pinyin:** chì
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** Simplified from 行: the left side of the crossroads pictogram as seen from above; cf. the top component of 辵.
  - **interpretation:** Derived by isolating the left half of 行, an overhead view of a crossroads. The form came to signify a single step and, by extension, walking; it parallels the abbreviated top of 辵 in motion-related characters.
- **examples:**
  - 他独自彳亍在小巷中(他獨自彳亍在小巷中)，思绪万千(思緒萬千)。
    - Tā dúzì chìchù zài xiǎoxiàng zhōng, sīxù wànqiān.
    - He wandered slowly in the alley, lost in thought.
  - 彳是部首之一(彳是部首之一)，常见于表示行走的字(常見於表示行走的字)。
    - Chì shì bùshǒu zhī yī, chángjiàn yú biǎoshì xíngzǒu de zì.
    - Rěn is one of the radicals, often seen in characters related to walking.
  - 字典将“彳”读作“chì”(字典將「彳」讀作「chì」)，义为“行走(義為「行走)、步”(步」)。
    - Zìdiǎn jiāng “chì” dúzuò “chì”, yìwéi “xíngzǒu, bù”.
    - Dictionaries read “彳” as “chì,” meaning “to walk; step.”
### 得 → 贝(貝)
- **definition:** cowry; money
- **pinyin:** bèi
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** Pictogram – cowrie used as currency in ancient China; simplified form of 貝 in cursive script.
  - **interpretation:** Depicts a cowry shell, an object that functioned as early money, which motivates the senses “cowry; money.” In the simplified set, its strokes were streamlined by adopting a cursive-style form of 貝.
  - **simplification:** Adopted the cursive-script variant of 貝, reducing strokes and complexity.
- **examples:**
  - 古代用贝(貝)当作货币(貨幣)。
    - Gǔdài yòng bèi dāngzuò huòbì.

    - Zhè chuàn xiàngliàn shì yòng bèi zuò de.

### 得 → 又
- **definition:** again; right hand
- **pinyin:** yòu
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** Pictogram – a right hand; original form of 右; unrelated to 𠬤 (> 译). Often written as 彐 in many modern characters (e.g., 事, 聿, 雪, 急, 爭, 尹, 建).
  - **interpretation:** Early graphs depict a right hand, which later gave rise to 右 ‘right (side)’. The adverbial sense ‘again’ developed later by semantic extension. In many compounds a similar shape is written as 彐, but that is a graphic convention rather than a direct historical component here.
- **examples:**
  - 他又来了(他又來了)。
    - Tā yòu lái le.
    - He came again.
  - 请向右转(請向右轉)。
    - Qǐng xiàng yòu zhuǎn.
    - Please turn right.
