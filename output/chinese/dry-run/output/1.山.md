## 山

## mountain
### shān
---
- **definition:** mountain
- **pinyin:** shān
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** Pictogram (象形) — three mountain peaks; oracle forms show triangles rather than vertical strokes. Unrelated to 出, the top of 岁/豐, 屮, and 巾.
  - **interpretation:** A visual sketch of a jagged ridge: one tall central peak flanked by two smaller ones. Earlier inscriptions rendered the peaks as simple triangles that later regularized into three vertical lines. Similar-looking forms like 出 or elements in 岁/豐 are lookalikes with no historical connection.
- **examples:**
  - 我们去爬山(我們去爬山)。
    - Wǒmen qù pá shān.
    - We’re going to hike/climb in the mountains.
  - 那座山很高(那座山很高)。
    - Nà zuò shān hěn gāo.
    - That mountain is very tall.
  - 山上有很多树(山上有很多樹)。
    - Shān shàng yǒu hěn duō shù.
    - There are many trees on the mountain.
