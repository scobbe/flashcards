## 来吧(來吧)
---
- **pinyin:** lái ba
- **definition:** come on
- **characters:**
  - 来(來)
    - lái
    - come, arrive; future, coming, next; since, over the past; to order or request
  - 吧
    - ba
    - modal particle for suggestion or mild command, softening tone; expresses probability or uncertainty; indicates agreement or consent; seeks confirmation, tag-question effect
- **etymology:** 来(來) (lái, "come") supplies the deictic pull toward the speaker or the onset of an action, and 吧 (ba, "suggestive particle") reframes a bare imperative as a friendly, cooperative prompt—yielding an encouraging “come on” rather than a command. This softening traces to 吧 inheriting the sentence‑final invitational/cessative force of 罷 (bà, "that’s enough; ending particle") in classical patterns like 走罷, so 来吧 functions as a polite invitation to approach or begin.
- **examples:**
  - 来吧(來吧)，我们一起试试(我們一起試試)。
    - lái ba, wǒmen yìqǐ shìshi
    - Come on, let's try it together.
