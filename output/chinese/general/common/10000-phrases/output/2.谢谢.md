  - 谢(謝)
    - xiè
    - to thank; to apologize; to wither, fade; to decline, refuse
- **etymology:** Rooted in ritual politeness where 谢(謝) (xiè, "to decline; to thank") originally meant verbally deflecting or modestly declining a favor, gratitude is conceptualized as a deferential response. Reduplication (AA) in Chinese marks a brief, softened, courteous act, so repeating 谢(謝) signals polite, sincere acknowledgment—an everyday verbal bow.
- **examples:**
  - 谢谢你的帮助(謝謝你的幫助)。
    - xièxie nǐ de bāngzhù
