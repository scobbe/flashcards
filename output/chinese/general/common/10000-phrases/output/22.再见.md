## 再见(再見)
---
- **pinyin:** zàijiàn
- **definition:** goodbye
- **characters:**
  - 再
    - zài
    - again, once more, re-; more, further; then, later
  - 见(見)
    - jiàn, xiàn
    - see, perceive; meet; be seen, appear; opinion, view
- **etymology:** Literally 'again see,' 再 (zài, "again") adverbially projects a next occasion while 见(見) (jiàn, "see/meet") names the encounter, yielding the elliptical promise 'let’s see each other again' used as a polite, non-final parting. This future-oriented formula reflects classical ellipsis and parallels the older farewell 再會 with 會(会) (huì, "meet"), emphasizing auspicious continuity over finality.
- **examples:**
  - 再见(再見)！
    - zàijiàn
    - Goodbye!
