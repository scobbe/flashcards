## 不要
---
- **pinyin:** bú yào
- **definition:** don't; don't want
- **characters:**
  - 不
    - bù
    - not, no; un-, non-
  - 要
    - yào
    - to want, wish; to need, require; to demand, ask for; will, be going to
- **etymology:** Negating the modal‑volitional 要 (yào, "to want/need; be going to") with 不 (bù, "not") flips intention/necessity into prohibition, so 不要 means either 'not want/need' in statements or 'don't (do it)' as an imperative. Because 要 also carries the sense 'be about to/will,' its negation naturally reads as 'do not be about to…'—a conventional Chinese way to express 'don't.'.
- **examples:**
  - 不要在这里抽烟(不要在這裡抽煙)！
    - bú yào zài zhè lǐ chōu yān
    - Don't smoke here!
  - 我不要喝咖啡(我不要喝咖啡)，我想喝茶(我想喝茶)。
    - wǒ bú yào hē kā fēi, wǒ xiǎng hē chá
    - I don't want coffee; I want tea.
