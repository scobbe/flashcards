## 什么(什麼)
---
- **pinyin:** shénme
- **definition:** what
- **characters:**
  - 什
    - shén, shí
    - what (in 什麼/什么); assorted goods, sundries; ten (in set phrases)
  - 么(麼)
    - me, yāo, mó
    - interrogative suffix (what, how); degree suffix meaning so, to such an extent; one (when reading numbers); insignificant, petty
- **etymology:** Originally written 甚麼, with 甚 (shén, "how; to what extent") plus 麼 (me, "interrogative/indefinite suffix" built on 幺 (yāo, "tiny")), yielding an open-ended query of degree that vernacular speech generalized to "what." The later substitution 什 (shén, "miscellaneous; ten") for 甚 in Northern Mandarin is a phonetic replacement whose "miscellaneous/unspecified" nuance also aligns with asking about an unknown item, hence 什麼.
- **examples:**
  - 你要什么(你要什麼)？
    - nǐ yào shénme
    - What do you want?
