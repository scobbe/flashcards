## 什么事(什麼事)
---
- **pinyin:** shénme shì
- **definition:** what's the matter?
- **characters:**
  - 什
    - shén
    - what (in 什么); miscellaneous, assorted; odds and ends, sundries; unit of ten (ancient grouping)
  - 么(麼)
    - me
    - interrogative suffix; degree suffix meaning so, such
  - 事
    - shì
    - matter, affair, thing; work, job; event, incident; problem, trouble
- **etymology:** From the older 甚麼, 什 (shén, "what") is a phonetic-loan stand-in for 甚 (shén, "to what extent; what") with 么(麼) (me, "interrogative suffix") forming the general interrogative "what". Adding 事 (shì, "affair, matter") targets the question at situations/problems rather than objects—literally "what affair?"—hence the idiomatic "what's the matter?".
- **examples:**
  - 什么事(什麼事)？
    - shénme shì
