- **etymology:** 好 (hǎo, "good") nominalized by 的 (de, "attributive/nominalizer") literally yields “the good one/that which is good,” so as a reply it elliptically means “the (proposed) plan/arrangement is good,” i.e., accepted. In modern vernacular where 的 (de, "attributive/nominalizer") supplanted Classical 之 (zhī, "attributive/possessive particle"), such clipped nominalized replies became a polite, neutral way to say “ok; all right.”.
