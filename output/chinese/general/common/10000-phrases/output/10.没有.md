## 没有(沒有)
---
- **pinyin:** méiyǒu
- **definition:** not have; there is not
- **characters:**
  - 没(沒)
    - méi
    - not; have not; without; to sink, submerge
  - 有
    - yǒu
    - to have, possess, own; there is, there are
- **etymology:** 没(沒) (méi, "not; to sink, submerge") negates by evoking something swallowed by water; placed before 有 (yǒu, "to have; there is") it depicts 'having' as having sunk/vanished, yielding 'do not have/there isn't.' In Classical Chinese, existential negation was 無 (wú, "without; there is not"); in vernacular Mandarin this role shifted to 没(沒), and since 不 (bù, "not") does not pair with 有 (yǒu, "to have; there is"), the fixed collocation 没(沒)+有 became standard (often shortened to 没(沒)).
- **examples:**
  - 我没有钱(我沒有錢)。
    - wǒ méiyǒu qián
    - I don't have money.
  - 这儿没有人(這兒沒有人)。
    - zhèr méiyǒu rén
    - There is no one here.
