## 快点(快點)
---
- **pinyin:** kuài diǎn
- **definition:** hurry up
- **characters:**
  - 快
    - kuài
    - fast, quick; soon, about to; happy, pleased; sharp, keen
  - 点(點)
    - diǎn
    - dot, point; o'clock; to order (food, drinks); to light, ignite
- **etymology:** 快 (kuài, "fast") modified by 点(點) (diǎn, "dot; point; a bit") follows the Adj + 点(點) pattern meaning 'a bit more X', so 'a bit faster'—an idiomatic nudge to increase speed here and now, i.e., 'hurry up.' Historically 点(點) denotes a small 'point/amount,' and in colloquial imperatives it softens the command by quantifying the requested increase, turning a blunt 快 into a polite, actionable prompt.
- **examples:**
  - 快点(快點)，我们要迟到了(我們要遲到了)。
    - kuài diǎn wǒmen yào chí dào le
    - Hurry up, we're going to be late.
