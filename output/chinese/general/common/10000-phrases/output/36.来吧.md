## 来吧(來吧)
---
- **pinyin:** lái ba
- **definition:** come on
- **characters:**
  - 来(來)
    - lái
    - come, arrive; next, future; used after a verb to indicate motion toward the speaker; do, have (colloquial)
  - 吧
    - ba
    - modal particle indicating suggestion, request, mild command; modal particle indicating probability, supposition; softening particle making a statement tentative or polite
- **etymology:** 来(來) (lái, "come; move toward the speaker"), which often serves as a colloquial kickoff for initiating action, is softened by sentence-final 吧 (ba, "suggestion/mitigation particle") so a bare imperative turns into a friendly invitation or coaxing nudge—pragmatically like English 'come on' to beckon or to spur starting something (enter, drink, begin). In Mandarin, such particles calibrate stance, so 来吧 signals encouragement seeking the listener's alignment rather than command.
- **examples:**
  - 来吧(來吧)，我们开始吧(我們開始吧)。
    - lái ba, wǒmen kāishǐ ba
    - Come on, let's begin.
