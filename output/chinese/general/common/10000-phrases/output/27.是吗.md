## 是吗(是嗎)
---
- **pinyin:** shì ma
- **definition:** really?; is that so?
- **characters:**
  - 是
    - shì
    - to be, is, are, am; yes, correct, right; indeed, really
  - 吗(嗎)
    - ma
    - question particle for yes–no questions
- **etymology:** 是 (shì, "to be; correct/true") names the state of truth, and sentence‑final 吗(嗎) (ma, "yes–no question particle") turns the utterance into an elliptical 'is [that] so?'—a request for confirmation. Rooted in Classical usage where 是 (shì, "right/correct") stood in opposition to 非 (fēi, "not; wrong"), the pairing naturally queries whether a proposition should count as 'right/true.'.
