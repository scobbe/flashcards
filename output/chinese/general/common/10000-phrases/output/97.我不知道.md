## 我不知道
---
- **pinyin:** wǒ bù zhīdào
- **definition:** I don't know
- **characters:**
  - 我
    - wǒ
    - I, me; my; self, ego
  - 不
    - bù
    - not; no; un-, non-
  - 知
    - zhī
    - to know, be aware of; to inform, notify
  - 道
    - dào
    - road, path; way, method; to say, speak; Dao, the Way
- **etymology:** 我 (wǒ, "I") and 不 (bù, "not") negate the speaker’s relation to 知道, where 知 (zhī, "to know") + 道 (dào, "Way; to speak") fuses the classical sense of grasping the right path/order of things with the ability to articulate it. Colored by 道’s Daoist notion of an underlying Way, 我不知道 literally says the speaker lacks the path to the matter (and thus cannot say), i.e., "I don't know.".
- **examples:**
  - 对不起(對不起)，我不知道(我不知道)。
    - duìbuqǐ wǒ bù zhīdào
    - Sorry, I don't know.
