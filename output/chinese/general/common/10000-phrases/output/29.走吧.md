## 走吧
---
- **pinyin:** zǒu ba
- **definition:** let's go
- **characters:**
  - 走
    - zǒu
    - to walk; to leave, go away; to run, operate (of machines, time); to die, pass away (euphemism)
  - 吧
    - ba
    - final particle indicating suggestion, request, mild command; final particle indicating uncertainty, probability, hedging; expressing agreement or concession, OK, all right
- **etymology:** Imperative 走 (zǒu, "to walk/leave") becomes an inclusive proposal when capped with 吧 (ba, "sentence-final particle of proposal/softening"), which in Chinese discourse norms turns a blunt command into joint action—effectively a polite 'shall we go'. Since 走 (zǒu, "to walk/leave") extends colloquially to 'set off/leave', 走吧 naturally cues initiating departure in any mode, not just on foot.
- **examples:**
  - 走吧(走吧)，我们该出发了(我們該出發了)。
    - zǒu ba wǒmen gāi chūfā le
    - Let's go, it's time for us to set off.
