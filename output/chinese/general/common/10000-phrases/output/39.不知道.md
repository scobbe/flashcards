## 不知道
---
- **pinyin:** bù zhīdào
- **definition:** don't know
- **characters:**
  - 不
    - bù
    - not; no
  - 知
    - zhī
    - to know, be aware; to inform, notify
  - 道
    - dào
    - road, path, route; method, way, means; the Way, Tao; to say, speak
- **etymology:** Literally "know the way", 知 (zhī, "to know") + 道 (dào, "way; method; the Way") follows a classical verb-object pattern where understanding is framed as knowing the proper path/principle, shaped by the cultural weight of 道 as the normative course of things. Adding 不 (bù, "not") simply negates that state—"not know the way of it"—which generalized to "don't know.".
- **examples:**
  - 我不知道他为什么生气(我不知道他為什麼生氣)。
    - wǒ bù zhīdào tā wèishénme shēngqì
    - I don't know why he's angry.
