## 怎么了(怎麼了)
---
- **pinyin:** zěnme le
- **definition:** what's up?; what's wrong?
- **characters:**
  - 怎
    - zěn
    - how; why
  - 么(麼)
    - me
    - interrogative suffix forming what/how words; indefinite suffix forming some-, any- words
  - 了
    - le
    - aspect particle marking completed action; sentence-final particle indicating change of state, new situation
- **etymology:** 怎 (zěn, "how; why") with 么(麼) (me, "interrogative suffix") forms the open-ended manner question "how?", and sentence-final 了 (le, "change-of-state particle") frames the clause as a newly arisen situation, so the literal sense is "how has it (now) become?", i.e., "what happened?" When directed at a person—often with the understood subject 你—it zeroes in on an unexpected change or anomaly, hence the empathetic "what's wrong?/what's up?" in modern colloquial Mandarin.
- **examples:**
  - 你找我(你找我)，怎么了(怎麼了)？
    - nǐ zhǎo wǒ zěnme le
    - You were looking for me—what's up?
  - 你脸色不太好(你臉色不太好)，怎么了(怎麼了)？
    - nǐ liǎnsè bú tài hǎo zěnme le
