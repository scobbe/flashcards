## 很好
---
- **pinyin:** hěn hǎo
- **definition:** very good
- **characters:**
  - 很
    - hěn
    - very, quite, really
  - 好
    - hǎo
    - good, fine, nice; well, healthy; OK, all right; easy to
- **etymology:** 很 (hěn, "very") functions as a degree-marking linker before predicate adjectives, so 很好 reads as good to a high degree; in everyday Mandarin 很 often just fills the required degree slot, making it sound simply good unless emphasized. 好 (hǎo, "good") pictographically unites 女 (nǚ, "woman") and 子 (zǐ, "child") to symbolize well-being, so intensifying it yields the idiomatic very good and also the polite evaluative fine/OK.
- **examples:**
  - 天气很好(天氣很好)，我们去散步吧(我們去散步吧)。
    - tiānqì hěn hǎo, wǒmen qù sànbù ba
    - The weather is very good; let's go for a walk.
