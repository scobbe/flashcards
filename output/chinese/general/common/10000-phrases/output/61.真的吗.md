## 真的吗(真的嗎)
---
- **pinyin:** zhēn de ma
- **definition:** really?; is that true?
- **characters:**
  - 真
    - zhēn
    - true, real, genuine; really, truly; truth, reality
  - 的
    - de
    - possessive marker, 's; attributive particle linking modifiers to nouns; nominalizer turning clauses, adjectives into nouns
  - 吗(嗎)
    - ma
    - question particle for yes/no questions, sentence-final
- **etymology:** Elliptical for 這是真的嗎, where 真 (zhēn, "true") is turned into a state/noun phrase by 的 (de, "nominalizer/attributive"), and 吗(嗎) (ma, "yes/no particle") converts the bare assertion into a polar question—literally, "[is it] the true [one/state]?" This works because colloquial Mandarin often drops the subject and copula when the predicate is a nominalized adjective, so 真的嗎 directly queries the truth-status of what was just said.

  - 你今天不用上班(你今天不用上班)，真的吗(真的嗎)？
    - nǐ jīntiān bú yòng shàngbān, zhēn de ma
