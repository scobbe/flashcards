- **etymology:** 我 (wǒ, "I") sets the subject, while 知 (zhī, "be aware") + 道 (dào, "way; principle; to say") evokes the classical idea that genuine knowing is to grasp the Way/principle of a matter—and even be able to speak it—so 知道 lexicalized as the everyday verb "to know," yielding 我知道 "I know.".

    - wǒ zhīdào
    - I know.
