## 什么(什麼)
---
- **pinyin:** shénme
- **definition:** what?
- **characters:**
  - 什
    - shén
    - what; assorted, various; household goods, utensils; ten
  - 么(麼)
    - me
    - interrogative suffix; how, to what extent; small, insignificant
- **etymology:** Vernacular 甚麼 became 什麼: 甚 (shén, "how; to what extent") marks indeterminacy, and 么(麼) (me, "interrogative suffix") turns it into a question-word. In northern usage 甚 was replaced by 什 (shén, "assorted; various; household goods") as a phonetic/graphic loan, and its sense of “assorted stuff” (cf. 什物) reinforces the idea of an unspecified thing—hence “what?”.
- **examples:**
  - 你在做什么(你在做什麼)？
    - nǐ zài zuò shénme
    - What are you doing?
