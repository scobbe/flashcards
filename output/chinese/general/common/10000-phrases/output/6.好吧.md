## 好吧
---
- **pinyin:** hǎo ba
- **definition:** alright; fine
- **characters:**
  - 好
    - hǎo
    - good, fine, well; to like, be fond of; easy; very, quite
  - 吧
    - ba
    - sentence-final particle for suggestion, request, mild command; sentence-final particle indicating probability or uncertainty, I suppose; sentence-final particle to soften tone or seek agreement; in loanwords for bar, pub
- **etymology:** 好 (hǎo, "good/okay") states approval; adding 吧 (ba, "sentence-final softener seeking agreement") recasts it as a negotiated, mitigated stance—“let’s call it good then”—signaling acceptance rather than enthusiasm. In Mandarin interactional pragmatics this marks concession or compliance, so 好吧 reads as an acquiescent “alright/fine,” not a firm “yes.”.
- **examples:**
  - 好吧(好吧)，我们就这么定了(我們就這麼定了)。
    - hǎo ba, wǒmen jiù zhème dìng le
    - Alright, we'll settle it like this.
  - 好吧(好吧)，你赢了(你贏了)。
    - hǎo ba, nǐ yíng le
    - Fine, you win.
