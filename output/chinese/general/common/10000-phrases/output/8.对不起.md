## 对不起(對不起)
---
- **pinyin:** duìbuqǐ
- **definition:** sorry
- **characters:**
  - 对(對)
    - duì
    - correct, right; to, toward; pair, couple; to treat, deal with
  - 不
    - bù
    - not, no; un-, non- prefix
  - 起
    - qǐ
    - to rise, get up; to start, begin; to raise, lift; classifier for occurrences, cases
- **etymology:** Literally 'cannot rise to face (you)': 对(對) (duì, "to face; to treat; right"), 不 (bù, "not"), and 起 (qǐ, "rise; as a complement 'manage to'") form a resultative sense of being unable to measure up and thus unworthy to face the other. Rooted in a colloquial pattern where 起 (qǐ, "manage to") marks feasibility, the phrase encodes confession of failing to meet an expected standard under social "face" norms, hence an apology.
- **examples:**
  - 对不起(對不起)，我来晚了(我來晚了)。
    - duìbuqǐ, wǒ lái wǎn le
    - Sorry, I'm late.
