## 没问题(沒問題)
---
- **pinyin:** méi wèntí
- **definition:** no problem
- **characters:**
  - 没(沒)
    - méi
    - not (before verbs); not have; to sink, submerge
  - 问(問)
    - wèn
    - to ask, inquire; to question, interrogate; to inquire after, send regards; to hold accountable, call to account
  - 题(題)
    - tí
    - problem, exam question; topic, subject; title; to inscribe, write (a title or brief note)
- **etymology:** Negating 问题 (built from 问(問) (wèn, "to ask; hold to account") and 题(題) (tí, "title/topic" → "exam problem"), i.e., an issue that invites questioning/examination) with 没(沒) (méi, "not; not have") says there is nothing even to ask or hold to account—hence "no problem." As a clipped form of 没有问题, it moves from the literal "no questions/issues" to a reassuring assent that nothing will impede the matter.
- **examples:**
  - 没问题(沒問題)，我明天按时到(我明天按時到)。
    - méi wèntí wǒ míngtiān ànshí dào
    - No problem, I'll arrive on time tomorrow.
