- **etymology:** 谢(謝) (xiè, 'to thank; politely decline') arose as a courteous verbal response—built from 言 (yán, 'speech') + 射 (shè, 'shoot', phonetic)—so expressing thanks traditionally implies humbly deflecting a favor back to the giver; reduplication in 谢谢(謝謝) follows the Chinese habit of repeating a verb to soften and colloquialize it, turning formal gratitude into a brief, warm interjection.
