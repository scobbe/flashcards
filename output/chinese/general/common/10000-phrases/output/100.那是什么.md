## 那是什么(那是什麼)
---
- **pinyin:** nà shì shénme

    - that, those; then, in that case
  - 是
    - shì
    - to be; yes; correct, right
  - 什

    - what (in 什麼/什么)
  - 么(麼)
    - me
    - suffix forming interrogatives or degree adverbs, as in 什麼/什么, 怎麼/怎么, 那麼/那么
- **etymology:** Distal pointer 那 (nà, "that") and equative 是 (shì, "to be") set up an identification clause, while the vernacular interrogative 什麼 formed by 什 (shén, "what; originally ‘assorted’ used phonetically here") + 么(麼) (me, "interrogative suffix") fills the predicate slot; in Chinese wh-in-situ grammar, you ask by leaving the unknown as 什麼, so it literally poses "That is what?". Historically 什麼 condenses earlier 甚 (shén, "what") + 麼 (me) in 甚麼, which explains the shén reading of 什 in this compound.
- **examples:**
  - 那是什么(那是什麼)？
    - nà shì shénme
    - What's that?
