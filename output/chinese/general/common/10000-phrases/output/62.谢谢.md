## 谢谢(謝謝)
---
- **pinyin:** xièxie
- **definition:** thanks; thank you
- **characters:**
  - 谢(謝)
    - xiè
    - to thank, thanks; to decline, refuse; to wither, fade; Xie, a surname
  - 谢(謝)
    - xiè
    - to thank, thanks; to decline, refuse; to wither, fade; Xie, a surname
- **etymology:** AA verbal reduplication marks a light, courteous act, so saying it twice is a softened performative—“let me thank-thank,” a brief, polite acknowledgment rather than heavy gratitude. The core sense of 谢(謝) (xiè, "to thank; to decline; to wither") is deferential stepping-back, so repeating it echoes traditional etiquette of modestly withdrawing before another’s favor, much like repeated bows or ritual declinations.
