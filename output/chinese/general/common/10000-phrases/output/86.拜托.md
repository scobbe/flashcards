## 拜托(拜託)
---
- **pinyin:** bàituō
- **definition:** please; come on (I beg you)
- **characters:**
  - 拜
    - bài
    - to worship, pray; to bow, pay respects; to pay a visit, call on; to formally acknowledge as master, teacher
  - 托(託)
    - tuō
    - to entrust, ask (someone) to do something; to hold up, support with the hand; pretext, excuse; to consign, check (baggage)
- **etymology:** Ritual deference plus entrusting: 拜 (bài, "to bow/pray") evokes lowering oneself in a formal plea, while 托(託) (tuō, "to entrust/ask a favor") is literally placing a matter in another’s hands—trad. 託 with 言 signals a spoken request. Together they picture “bowing to entrust a task,” hence a humble “please,” which in modern speech easily shifts into the dramatic interjection “come on/oh please” to press or protest.
- **examples:**
  - 拜托你帮我跟老板说一声(拜託你幫我跟老闆說一聲)，好吗(好嗎)？
    - bàituō nǐ bāng wǒ gēn lǎobǎn shuō yī shēng, hǎo ma
    - Please help me put in a word with the boss, okay?
