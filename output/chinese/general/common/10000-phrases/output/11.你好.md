- **etymology:** Addresses the interlocutor directly with 你 (nǐ, "you") and predicates a positive state with 好 (hǎo, "good"), yielding an elided “Are you well?”—a benedictive greeting that foregrounds the other’s wellbeing. As a modern vernacular formula popularized with 20th‑century Mandarin, it parallels “good day,” using 好’s evaluative sense as a courteous wish rather than a literal description.
- **examples:**
  - 你好(你好)！
