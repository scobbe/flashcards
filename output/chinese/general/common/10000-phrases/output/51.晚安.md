## 晚安
---
- **pinyin:** wǎn'ān
- **definition:** good night
- **characters:**
  - 晚
    - wǎn
    - late, tardy; evening; later, latter
  - 安
    - ān
    - peace, calm; safe, secure; to install, set up; to pacify, settle
- **etymology:** 晚 (wǎn, "evening/late") marks the time, while 安 (ān, "peace/safety") is a classical benediction found in greetings and in terms like 安眠, so the phrase literally wishes one to be safe and at peace through the night—a vulnerable time historically. As a modern salutation built on the time-word + 安 pattern, it renders “good night” in a distinctly Chinese blessing of calm and safety.
- **examples:**
  - 我先睡了(我先睡了)，晚安(晚安)！
    - wǒ xiān shuì le, wǎn'ān!
    - I'm going to sleep now, good night!
