## 听着(聽著)
---
- **pinyin:** tīngzhe
- **definition:** listen; listen up
- **characters:**
  - 听(聽)
    - tīng
    - listen, hear; obey; can, tin; measure word for canned beverages
  - 着(著)
    - zhe
    - aspect particle marking ongoing action; indicating a continuous state; used to mark an accompanying action, while doing; placed after a verb in imperatives for emphasis
- **etymology:** 听(聽) (tīng, "listen; heed") takes 着(著) (zhe, "attached/ongoing state") to cast listening as a maintained state—'keep your listening on'—which in colloquial Mandarin functions as an attention-command 'listen up'. The force also taps 聽 (tīng, "to heed/obey"), making it not just perception but a demand for sustained, compliant attention.
- **examples:**
  - 我听着你说(我聽著你說)。
    - wǒ tīngzhe nǐ shuō
    - I'm listening to you.
  - 听着(聽著)，别动(別動)！
    - tīngzhe, bié dòng
