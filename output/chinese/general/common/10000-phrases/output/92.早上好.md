- **etymology:** 早 (zǎo, "early; morning") and 上 (shàng, "upper; earlier") label the day's earlier/upper segment—Chinese maps time vertically (上=earlier, 下=later)—so 早上 means “morning.” Appending 好 (hǎo, "good") follows the modern greeting template “[time-of-day] + 好” (modeled on 你好) to politely wish that period to be good: “good morning.”.

  - 早上好(早上好)，老师(老師)！
