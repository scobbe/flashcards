## 现在(現在)
---
- **pinyin:** xiànzài
- **definition:** now
- **characters:**
  - 现(現)
    - xiàn
    - to appear, emerge; present, current; to show, display; cash, ready money
  - 在
    - zài
    - at, in, on; to be located, to be present; to exist; (before a verb) in the midst of, in progress
- **etymology:** 现(現) (xiàn, "to appear; manifest; present") names what has come into view, while 在 (zài, "to be at; exist") anchors it in existence, yielding “that which is manifestly extant” — the present moment. Fixed by Buddhist translation for the three times (past–present–future), it later shifted in vernacular from a noun “the present (time)” to the adverb “now,” resonating with 现(現)’s nuance of immediacy/being on hand (as in “ready money”).
- **examples:**
  - 我现在没空(我現在沒空)，可以晚点再说吗(可以晚點再說嗎)？
    - wǒ xiànzài méi kòng, kěyǐ wǎn diǎn zài shuō ma
    - I don't have time now; can we talk later?
