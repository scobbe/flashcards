## 我不知道
---
- **pinyin:** wǒ bù zhīdào
- **definition:** I don't know
- **characters:**
  - 我
    - wǒ
    - I, me; my, mine; self, ego
  - 不
    - bù
    - not, no
  - 知
    - zhī
    - to know, be aware; to inform, notify
  - 道
    - dào
    - road, path, way; method, principle, doctrine, Dao; to say, speak; classifier for dishes, questions, orders
- **etymology:** 我 (wǒ, "I") with the pre-verbal negator 不 (bù, "not") precedes 知道—where 知 (zhī, "to know") + 道 (dào, "way; to speak") originally meant "to know the path/principle" or "to know it well enough to state it"—a historical verb–object phrase that fused into the single verb "to know." Thus it literally says "I not know-the-way," tapping the Chinese metaphor of 道 as the right path/doctrine to convey simple ignorance.
- **examples:**
  - 我不知道发生了什么(我不知道發生了什麼)。
    - wǒ bù zhīdào fāshēng le shénme
    - I don't know what happened.
