## 你说什么(你說什麼)
---
- **pinyin:** nǐ shuō shénme
- **definition:** what did you say?
- **characters:**
  - 你
    - nǐ
    - you
  - 说(說)
    - shuō
    - to speak, to say; to explain; to persuade; theory, opinion
  - 什
    - shén
    - what; assorted, various; squad, file
  - 么(麼)
    - me
    - interrogative suffix, in what or how; tiny, small
- **etymology:** Addressing the listener with 你 (nǐ, "you") and the act 说(說) (shuō, "speak"), then placing 什 (shén, "assorted" > "what") + 么(麼) (me, "tiny; suffix" > interrogative) after the verb follows Mandarin’s in-situ wh pattern—literally “You speak what?”—so it queries the content of the speech. In 什麼, 什 (shén) is a later phonetic stand-in for 甚 (shén, "how; to what extent"), while 么(麼) fossilized as a question suffix, yielding the general pronoun “what,” which makes 你说什么 the natural prompt for repetition or clarification.
- **examples:**
  - 对不起(對不起)，你说什么(你說什麼)？
    - duìbùqǐ, nǐ shuō shénme?
    - Sorry, what did you say?
