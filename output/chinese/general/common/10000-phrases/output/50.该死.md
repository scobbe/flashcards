## 该死(該死)
---
- **pinyin:** gāisǐ
- **definition:** damn
- **characters:**
  - 该(該)
    - gāi
    - should, ought to; this, that, the said, aforesaid; it's one's turn; deserve (often in set phrases)
  - 死
    - sǐ
    - to die, perish; death; dead; extremely, to death (as intensifier)
- **etymology:** Rooted in imperial verdict language (e.g., 該當死罪) where 该(該) (gāi, "should/ought/deserve") states what is due and 死 (sǐ, "die") names the ultimate penalty, it literally declares someone “deserving of death,” a formal moral-legal condemnation that migrated into colloquial cursing and self-reproach (e.g., 我该(該)死). In modern usage the lethal force is hyperbolic, so 该(該)死/该(該)死的 functions like “damn,” branding the target as blameworthy or infuriating.
- **examples:**
  - 该死(該死)，又把钥匙忘在家里了(又把鑰匙忘在家裡了)！
    - gāi sǐ yòu bǎ yàoshi wàng zài jiālǐ le
    - Damn, I left my keys at home again!
