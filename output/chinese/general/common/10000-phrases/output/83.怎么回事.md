## 怎么回事(怎麼回事)
---
- **pinyin:** zěnme huí shì
- **definition:** what's going on?
- **characters:**
  - 怎
    - zěn
    - how; why
  - 么(麼)
    - me
    - interrogative suffix; degree-marking suffix
  - 回
    - huí
    - to return, go back; to answer, reply; to turn around; time, classifier for occurrences
  - 事
    - shì
    - matter, affair, thing; event, incident; work, task; trouble, problem
- **etymology:** 怎 (zěn, "how; why") with 么(麼) (me, "interrogative suffix") asks about manner or cause, while 回 (huí, "turn; occurrence; classifier for times") plus 事 (shì, "affair; matter") is a northern colloquial pairing meaning a "turn of affairs" (as in 一回事). Hence 怎么回事 literally probes "how is this turn of affairs?", a vernacular idiom (attested in late-imperial speech) that seeks the nature or cause of the present situation—"what's going on?".
- **examples:**
  - 到底怎么回事(到底怎麼回事)？
    - dàodǐ zěnme huí shì
    - What on earth is going on?
