## 天哪
---
- **pinyin:** tiān na
- **definition:** oh my God; gosh
- **characters:**
  - 天
    - tiān
    - sky; day; weather; Heaven, God
  - 哪
    - nǎ, na
    - which, what; where; how; exclamatory particle, oh
- **etymology:** Invokes 天 (tiān, "Heaven; God")—the supreme moral authority in Chinese tradition—and follows it with 哪 (na, "exclamatory particle", from interrogative 哪 repurposed as an emotive final) to form a direct vocative, essentially "Heaven!", signaling shock, plea, or complaint. Like English "oh heavens," it appeals to 上天 rather than a personal deity, with 哪 also written as 呐 (na, "exclamatory") or 啊 (a, "ah") in variants (天呐/天啊) to carry the same emotive force.
- **examples:**
  - 天哪(天哪)，地震来了(地震來了)，快跑(快跑)！
    - tiān na dìzhèn lái le kuài pǎo
    - Oh my God, the earthquake is here, run!
  - 天哪(天哪)，这咖啡怎么这么苦(這咖啡怎麼這麼苦)。
    - tiān na zhè kāfēi zěnme zhème kǔ
    - Gosh, this coffee is so bitter.
