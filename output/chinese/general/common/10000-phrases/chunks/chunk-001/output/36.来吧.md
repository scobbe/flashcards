## 来吧(來吧)
---
## come on
### lái ba
---
- **definition:** come on
- **pinyin:** lái ba
- **components:**
  - 来(來)
    - lái
    - come; arrive; bring/bring over; lead into action
  - 吧
    - ba
    - modal particle; suggestion/‘let’s’; soften command/request; assumption ‘probably’
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** verb + modal particle (imperative/exhortative)
  - **description:** 来 (lái, come) + 吧 (ba, suggestion/softening particle) = exhortation or invitation: “come on/let’s.”
  - **interpretation:** Colloquial imperative or invitation that urges someone to start or join an action, softened by 吧 (ba, suggestion/softening). Often parallels patterns like 走吧 (zǒu ba, let’s go) and can precede an action clause, e.g., 来吧，我们开始 (kāishǐ, start).
  - **simplification:** 來 was simplified to 来 by reducing components during character reform; 吧 is unchanged. The phrase’s simplification comes solely from 来.
- **examples:**
  - 来吧(來吧)，我们走(我們走)。
    - Lái ba, wǒmen zǒu.
    - Come on, let’s go.
  - 别犹豫了(別猶豫了)，来吧(來吧)。
    - Bié yóuyù le, lái ba.
    - Don’t hesitate, come on.
  - 大家一起唱(大傢一起唱)，来吧(來吧)。
    - Dàjiā yìqǐ chàng, lái ba.
    - Everyone sing together—come on.
### 来吧(來吧) → 来(來)
- **definition:** come; arrive; bring/bring over; lead into action
- **pinyin:** lái
- **components:**
  - 麦(麥)
    - mài
    - wheat
  - 禾
    - hé
    - grain; cereal crop
  - 止
    - zhǐ
    - stop; foot (anc.)
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** Pictogram (象形) of wheat; later borrowed for “to come”.
  - **interpretation:** Originally a drawing of a wheat plant, with the central ear and upward leaves, plus lines for stem and roots. The sense “to come” is a semantic loan; scribes sometimes added motion-related elements like 止 or 辵 in early periods to mark the new meaning, but those additions did not persist.
  - **simplification:** The simplified form 来 adopts a long-used abbreviated/clerical variant of 來, reducing strokes by collapsing and streamlining the original wheat-shaped elements.
- **examples:**
  - 他明天来北京(他明天來北京)。
    - Tā míngtiān lái Běijīng.
    - He will come to Beijing tomorrow.
  - 我们来年再见(我們來年再見)。
    - Wǒmen láinián zàijiàn.
    - We’ll meet again next year.
  - 把那本书拿过来(把那本書拿過來)。
    - Bǎ nà běn shū ná guòlai.
    - Bring that book over (toward me).
### 来吧(來吧) → 来(來) → 麦(麥)
- **definition:** wheat
- **pinyin:** mài
- **components:**
  - 來
    - lái
    - to come
  - 夊
    - suī
    - to walk slowly
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** semantic: 夊 (‘slow step’) + phonetic: 來; 來 was originally used for ‘wheat’.
  - **interpretation:** Meaning is anchored by a ‘slow step/footprint’ semantic hint that evokes reaping or drooping stalks, while 來 supplies the sound. In early usage, 來 itself denoted ‘wheat’, which explains the tight semantic link that later specialized into 麥/麦.
  - **simplification:** Simplified from 麥 by streamlining the phonetic 來 and altering its 八 component to a single horizontal stroke (per Wiktionary), reducing strokes and compressing the original phono-semantic layout into 麦.
- **examples:**
  - 我家种了很多小麦(我家種了很多小麥)。
    - Wǒ jiā zhòng le hěn duō xiǎomài.
    - My family planted a lot of wheat.
  - 啤酒的麦芽很香(啤酒的麥芽很香)。
    - Píjiǔ de màiyá hěn xiāng.
    - The malt in the beer smells fragrant.
  - 大麦和小麦都是重要的粮食作物(大麥和小麥都是重要的糧食作物)。
    - Dàmài hé xiǎomài dōu shì zhòngyào de liángshí zuòwù.
    - Barley and wheat are both important food crops.
### 来吧(來吧) → 来(來) → 麦(麥) → 來(來)
- **definition:** to come
- **pinyin:** lái
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** Pictogram of wheat: middle line = ear, upward lines = leaves, downward lines = stem/roots; sometimes an extra top line. Borrowed early to mean “to come”; later additions like 止/辵 were not retained.
  - **interpretation:** Originally drew a stalk of wheat, with the central stroke as the ear and other strokes as leaves, stem, and roots. It was borrowed early to write “to come,” while 麥 later carried the grain meaning; their similar Old Chinese onsets likely facilitated the semantic shift.
  - **simplification:** Simplified to 来 by reducing and regularizing strokes, following common clerical/cursive forms to lower stroke count and ease writing.
- **examples:**
  - 请你早点来(請你早點來)。
    - Qǐng nǐ zǎodiǎn lái.
    - Please come earlier.
  - 他今天从上海来开会(他今天從上海來開會)。
    - Tā jīntiān cóng Shànghǎi lái kāihuì.
    - He came from Shanghai to attend a meeting.
  - 如果你有时间(如果你有時間)，明天再来我们家坐坐(明天再來我們家坐坐)。
    - Rúguǒ nǐ yǒu shíjiān, míngtiān zài lái wǒmen jiā zuòzuo.

### 来吧(來吧) → 来(來) → 麦(麥) → 夊(夊)
- **definition:** to walk slowly
- **pinyin:** suī
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** Pictogram—footprint (pointing down); variant of 夂. Compare 止 (leg up) and 𡕒 (toe left).
  - **interpretation:** Depicts a downward-pointing footprint, evoking a trailing, unhurried step. Its orientation sets it apart from related foot forms, aligning with the sense of slow, following movement.
- **examples:**
  - 他慢慢走(他慢慢走)。
    - Tā mànman zǒu.
    - He walks slowly.
  - 她步履缓慢(她步履緩慢)。
    - Tā bùlǚ huǎnmàn.

    - Háizi gēn zài hòumiàn, xúxú ér xíng.
    - The child follows behind, moving slowly.
### 来吧(來吧) → 来(來) → 禾(禾)
- **definition:** grain; cereal crop
- **pinyin:** hé
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** Pictogram — picture of a plant stalk; clearer in older forms; similar to 來 but unrelated to 釆; later gave 株 and 硃.
  - **interpretation:** Depicts a stalk of grain with a head and leaves, representing cereal crops in general. Early forms make the plant shape more obvious; despite resembling 來, it has a separate origin and later served as a basis for forms in characters like 株 and 硃.
- **examples:**
  - 田里长满了禾苗(田裡長滿了禾苗)。
    - Tián lǐ zhǎng mǎn le hé miáo.
    - The field is full of grain seedlings.
  - 秋天田野里的禾熟了(秋天田野裡的禾熟了)。
    - Qiūtiān tiányě lǐ de hé shú le.
    - In autumn, the grain crops in the fields have ripened.
  - 禾本科作物需要充足的阳光(禾本科作物需要充足的陽光)。
    - Hé běnkē zuòwù xūyào chōngzú de yángguāng.

### 来吧(來吧) → 来(來) → 止(止)
- **definition:** stop; foot (anc.)
- **pinyin:** zhǐ
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** Pictogram: a footprint pointing up (originally “foot”), later stylized as 龰; oracle forms show three toes and a sole.
  - **interpretation:** A footprint with toes pointing upward represents the foot. The sense broadened from the physical foot to the act of halting one’s step, hence “to stop”; the specific ‘toe’ meaning was preserved in 趾.
- **examples:**
  - 请立即停止前进(請立即停止前進)。
    - Qǐng lìjí tíngzhǐ qiánjìn.
    - Please stop advancing immediately.
  - 此处止步(此處止步)，非请勿入(非請勿入)。
    - Cǐ chù zhǐbù, fēi qǐng wù rù.

### 来吧(來吧) → 吧(吧)
- **definition:** modal particle; suggestion/‘let’s’; soften command/request; assumption ‘probably’
- **pinyin:** ba
- **components:**
  - 口
    - kǒu
    - mouth
  - 巴
    - bā
    - to long for; to cling
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** Phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** semantic: 口 (kǒu) + phonetic: 巴 (OC *praː).
  - **interpretation:** 口 (kǒu, mouth) signals a function related to speech or utterance, while 巴 (bā, to long for) provides the pronunciation. As a sentence-final particle, it modulates the tone of what’s said—softening requests, proposing suggestions, or indicating a tentative assumption—akin to particles like 吗 (ma, yes–no question particle) and 呢 (ne, continuation/softening particle).
- **examples:**
  - 我们走吧(我們走吧)。
    - Wǒmen zǒu ba.
    - Let’s go.
  - 给我一杯水吧(給我一杯水吧)。
    - Gěi wǒ yì bēi shuǐ ba.
    - Please give me a glass of water.
  - 他应该在家吧(他應該在家吧)。
    - Tā yīnggāi zài jiā ba.
    - He’s probably at home.
### 来吧(來吧) → 吧(吧) → 口(口)
- **definition:** mouth
- **pinyin:** kǒu
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** Pictogram (象形) – resembles an open mouth.
  - **interpretation:** A simple square outlines the opening of a mouth, with the empty center representing the oral cavity. It later became a common semantic component indicating speech, sounds, or openings, and in early compounds sometimes marked abstract meanings via association or borrowing.
- **examples:**
  - 他张开口(他張開口)，说了几句(說了幾句)。
    - Tā zhāngkāi kǒu, shuō le jǐ jù.
    - He opened his mouth and said a few sentences.
  - 一家三口住在这个小城(一家三口住在這個小城)。
    - Yì jiā sān kǒu zhù zài zhège xiǎo chéng.
    - A family of three lives in this small town.
  - 她咬了一口苹果(她咬了一口蘋果)。
    - Tā yǎo le yì kǒu píngguǒ.
    - She took a bite of the apple.
### 来吧(來吧) → 吧(吧) → 巴(巴)
- **definition:** to long for; to cling
- **pinyin:** bā
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** Pictogram — a huge snake; however, in 邑 and 色 it represents a person kneeling.
  - **interpretation:** Originally depicted a large snake with a curved body, giving it a simple, iconic shape. In certain composite characters like 邑 and 色, the same shape was repurposed to depict a kneeling person, showing how the graphic was reassigned contextually. The sense of clinging or yearning may echo the image of something coiling or holding on.
- **examples:**
  - 孩子巴着妈妈不放(孩子巴著媽媽不放)。
    - Háizi bāzhe māma bù fàng.
    - The child clung to his mother and wouldn’t let go.
  - 他巴不得马上成功(他巴不得馬上成功)。
    - Tā bābudé mǎshàng chénggōng.
    - He is eager to succeed right away.
