## 当然(當然)
---
## of course; certainly
### dāngrán
---
- **definition:** of course; certainly
- **pinyin:** dāngrán
- **components:**
  - 当(當)
    - dāng
    - to be; to act as; appropriate; should
  - 然
    - rán
    - thus; so; in this manner; right
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** compound word
  - **description:** 當 (dāng, to be; appropriate) + 然 (rán, thus; so) = naturally; as it should be.
  - **interpretation:** Combines 當 (dāng, to be; proper) with 然 (rán, thus; in this manner) to assert that a statement is self-evident or expected. In modern Mandarin it is an adverb meaning “of course; certainly,” often placed sentence-initially for emphasis.
  - **simplification:** 當 → 当 by adopting a long-used variant and reducing strokes; 然 unchanged. The form was simplified to lower stroke count while keeping pronunciation and core sense.
- **examples:**
  - 我当然会去(我當然會去).
    - Wǒ dāngrán huì qù.
    - Of course I’ll go.
  - 这件事她当然知道(這件事她當然知道).
    - Zhè jiàn shì tā dāngrán zhīdào.
    - She certainly knows about this.
  - 你不说我当然不会明白(你不說我當然不會明白).
    - Nǐ bù shuō wǒ dāngrán bù huì míngbai.
    - If you don’t say it, I certainly won’t understand.
### 当然(當然) → 当(當)
- **definition:** to be; to act as; appropriate; should
- **pinyin:** dāng
- **components:**
  - 尚
    - shàng
    - esteem; still
  - 田
    - tián
    - field
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** Phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** phonetic: 尚 + semantic: 田 (“field”); explained as fields facing each other.
  - **interpretation:** 尚 (shàng, esteem; still) suggests the sound, while 田 (tián, field) contributes an image of facing or alignment, which extended to senses of suitability and proper correspondence. Meanings broadened to ideas like “appropriate” as in 适当 (shìdàng, appropriate) and “to act as” as in 当老师 (dāng lǎoshī, to work as a teacher).
  - **simplification:** Adopted the popular cursive form of 當, regularized as 当 in the PRC simplification to reduce strokes by collapsing the 尚 and 田 components.
- **examples:**
  - 我当老师已经五年了(我當老師已經五年了)。
    - Wǒ dāng lǎoshī yǐjīng wǔ nián le.
    - I have been working as a teacher for five years.
  - 别把玩笑当真(別把玩笑當真)。
    - Bié bǎ wánxiào dàngzhēn.
    - Don't take a joke seriously.
  - 为人父母(為人父母)，当以身作则(當以身作則)。

### 当然(當然) → 当(當) → 尚(尚)
- **definition:** esteem; still
- **pinyin:** shàng
- **components:**
  - 八
    - bā
    - eight
  - 向
    - xiàng
    - toward; direction
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** semantic: 八 + phonetic: 向
  - **interpretation:** Built with 八 as the semantic element and 向 as the phonetic, aligning with their Old Chinese readings. 八 gives a general semantic tag while 向 contributes the shàng sound; the overall layout is similar to 冋.
- **examples:**
  - 事情尚未结束(事情尚未結束)。
    - Shìqíng shàng wèi jiéshù.
    - The matter is not over yet.
  - 他尚年轻(他尚年輕)，需要指导(需要指導)。
    - Tā shàng niánqīng, xūyào zhǐdǎo.
    - He is still young and needs guidance.
  - 他崇尚简约的生活方式(他崇尚簡約的生活方式)。
    - Tā chóngshàng jiǎnyuē de shēnghuó fāngshì.
    - He esteems a simple lifestyle.
### 当然(當然) → 当(當) → 尚(尚) → 八(八)
- **definition:** eight
- **pinyin:** bā
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** Pictogram: two bent lines indicating “to divide”; later borrowed to mean “eight” via homophony (original sense now in 分, 別).
  - **interpretation:** Depicts two strokes diverging to suggest splitting or separation. Later became a rebus for the number eight because it shared the same sound, while the original sense lived on in 分 and 別. Not the “two hands” component found in other characters.
- **examples:**
  - 我有八本书(我有八本書)。
    - Wǒ yǒu bā běn shū.
    - I have eight books.
  - 她八岁了(她八歲了)。
    - Tā bā suì le.
    - She is eight years old.
  - 我买了八个苹果(我買了八個蘋果)。
    - Wǒ mǎi le bā gè píngguǒ.
    - I bought eight apples.
### 当然(當然) → 当(當) → 尚(尚) → 向(嚮)
- **definition:** toward; direction
- **pinyin:** xiàng
- **components:**
  - 口
    - kǒu
    - mouth
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** ideogrammic compound
  - **description:** 宀 ‘house’ + 口 ‘mouth’; echoes in a place. Original form of 響; later borrowed to write 𠨍 (嚮). Similar to 冋.
  - **interpretation:** A mouth sounding under a roof evokes reverberation indoors, matching the sense later written as 響 ‘echo, sound’. By rebus borrowing the graph came to write 嚮 ‘to face, toward; direction’, which is the sense carried by modern 向.
- **examples:**
  - 我们向前走吧(我們向前走吧)。
    - Wǒmen xiàng qián zǒu ba.
    - Let’s walk forward.
  - 她向着窗户微笑(她向著窗戶微笑)。
    - Tā xiàngzhe chuānghu wēixiào.
    - She smiles toward the window.
  - 他向医院的方向跑去(他向醫院的方向跑去)。

### 当然(當然) → 当(當) → 尚(尚) → 向(嚮) → 口(口)
- **definition:** mouth
- **pinyin:** kǒu
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** Pictogram (象形) – resembles an open mouth.
  - **interpretation:** A simple square outlines the opening of a mouth, with the empty center representing the oral cavity. It later became a common semantic component indicating speech, sounds, or openings, and in early compounds sometimes marked abstract meanings via association or borrowing.
- **examples:**
  - 他张开口(他張開口)，说了几句(說了幾句)。
    - Tā zhāngkāi kǒu, shuō le jǐ jù.
    - He opened his mouth and said a few sentences.

    - Yì jiā sān kǒu zhù zài zhège xiǎo chéng.
    - A family of three lives in this small town.

    - Tā yǎo le yì kǒu píngguǒ.
    - She took a bite of the apple.
### 当然(當然) → 当(當) → 田(田)
- **definition:** field
- **pinyin:** tián
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** Pictogram: pictographic representation of a field divided into four sections.
  - **interpretation:** Depicts a top-down view of a plot divided by paths or furrows, which naturally came to denote farmland. The square-with-cross motif also lent itself in some ancient contexts to a mask-like image, influencing related graphs.
- **examples:**
  - 这片田很肥沃(這片田很肥沃)。
    - Zhè piàn tián hěn féiwò.
    - This field is very fertile.
  - 他们在田里劳动(他們在田裡勞動)。

    - In spring, farmers transplant rice seedlings in the fields.
### 当然(當然) → 然(然)
- **definition:** thus; so; in this manner; right
- **pinyin:** rán
- **components:**
  - 火
    - huǒ
    - fire
  - 肉
    - ròu
    - meat
  - 夕
    - xī
    - evening
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** Phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** phonetic 肰 (OC *njen) + semantic 火 ‘fire’; original sense ‘to burn’. In modern form the top-left 肉 is turned sideways, resembling 夕 with an extra stroke.
  - **interpretation:** Built with 火 (huǒ, fire) for meaning and 肰 (rán/OC *njen, phonetic) for sound, it first referred to burning; this root sense survives in 燃 (rán, to burn). Over time it grammaticalized into an adverbial/structural element meaning ‘thus/so’, seen in compounds like 然后 (ránhòu, then) and 当然 (dāngrán, of course). The upper-left shape looks like 夕 (xī, evening) today but historically comes from a rotated 肉 (ròu, meat).
- **examples:**
  - 然而(然而)，我们不能放弃希望(我們不能放棄希望)。
    - Rán'ér, wǒmen bùnéng fàngqì xīwàng.
    - However, we cannot give up hope.
  - 你当然可以参加比赛(你當然可以參加比賽)。
    - Nǐ dāngrán kěyǐ cānjiā bǐsài.
    - You can certainly take part in the competition.
  - 他先吃饭(他先吃飯)，然后去上班(然後去上班)。
    - Tā xiān chīfàn, ránhòu qù shàngbān.

### 当然(當然) → 然(然) → 火(火)
- **definition:** fire
- **pinyin:** huǒ
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** Pictogram (象形)
  - **description:** Pictographic representation of a fire; written as 灬 at the bottom of characters; original form retained in 灸; related shapes in 叟 (top, original) and 赤 (bottom).
  - **interpretation:** Depicts a flame with tongues of fire rising upward, which is why the shape is simple and angular. When used as a component at the bottom of other characters, it appears as the variant 灬 to fit the overall structure.
- **examples:**
  - 火很旺(火很旺)，别靠太近(別靠太近)。
    - Huǒ hěn wàng, bié kào tài jìn.
    - The fire is blazing; don't get too close.
  - 厨房着火了(廚房著火了)，马上打电话报警(馬上打電話報警)。
    - Chúfáng zháo huǒ le, mǎshàng dǎ diànhuà bàojǐng.

### 当然(當然) → 然(然) → 肉(肉)
- **definition:** meat
- **pinyin:** ròu
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** Pictogram: ribs/section of meat; stylized as 月 when beside a phonetic, and as 𱼀 or 夕 inside some characters.
  - **interpretation:** Depicts the cross-section of flesh with ribs or a slice of meat. In compounds it often appears as a component written like 月, or reduced to 𱼀/夕, which can be mistaken for the moon component but actually signals ‘meat/flesh.’
- **examples:**
  - 我不吃猪肉(我不吃豬肉)。
    - Wǒ bù chī zhūròu.
    - I don't eat pork.
  - 这道菜肉很多(這道菜肉很多)，很鲜嫩(很鮮嫩)。
    - Zhè dào cài ròu hěn duō, hěn xiānnèn.
    - This dish has a lot of meat; it's very tender.

    - Shòushāng hòu, tā shǒushang de ròu liè kāi le.

### 当然(當然) → 然(然) → 夕(夕)
- **definition:** evening
- **pinyin:** xī
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** pictogram: crescent moon; compare 月
  - **interpretation:** Depicts a crescent moon, evoking the time after sunset when evening begins. By association it came to denote evening and appears productively in words related to dusk and night.

    - Jīntiān de xīyáng hěn měi.
    - The evening sun is beautiful today.
