## 树叶(樹葉)
---
## leaves
### shùyè
---
- **definition:** leaves
- **pinyin:** shùyè
- **components:**
  - 树(樹)
    - shù
    - tree; to plant; to set up; to establish
  - 叶(葉)
    - yè
    - leaf; foliage; (surname); classifier for leaves/petals
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** compound word
  - **description:** 树(shù) + 叶(yè) = leaves of a tree.
  - **interpretation:** Specifies leaves that grow on trees, highlighting the foliage as part of a tree. Common in everyday and literary contexts, especially for seasonal imagery.
  - **simplification:** Both characters were simplified to reduce strokes: 樹 → 树 kept the 木 ‘tree’ radical and replaced the complex right-side phonetic; 葉 → 叶 dropped the 艹 ‘grass’ radical and simplified the phonetic component, making a high-frequency word faster to write.
- **examples:**
  - 秋天(秋天)，树叶变黄了(樹葉變黃了)。
    - Qiūtiān, shùyè biàn huáng le.
    - In autumn, the tree leaves turn yellow.
  - 风吹动树叶(風吹動樹葉)，沙沙作响(沙沙作響)。
    - Fēng chuīdòng shùyè, shāshā zuòxiǎng.
    - The wind moves the tree leaves, making a rustling sound.
  - 我们在地上捡树叶做标本(我們在地上撿樹葉做標本)。
    - Wǒmen zài dìshang jiǎn shùyè zuò biāoběn.
    - We picked up tree leaves from the ground to make specimens.
### 树叶(樹葉) → 树(樹)
- **definition:** tree; to plant; to set up; to establish
- **pinyin:** shù
- **components:**
  - 木
    - mù
    - wood; tree
  - 又
    - yòu
    - again; right hand
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** semantic: 木 'tree' + phonetic: 尌 ('to plant a tree'); simplified: 壴 → 又
  - **interpretation:** 木 provides the meaning domain of wood/trees, while 尌 contributes the sound and is itself related to planting. In the simplified form, the complex 壴 inside the phonetic component was replaced by 又 to reduce strokes while retaining recognizability.
  - **simplification:** Component 壴 in the phonetic 尌 was replaced by 又 to lower stroke count while keeping 木 on the left for meaning.
- **examples:**
  - 我们在公园里种树(我們在公園裡種樹)。
    - Wǒmen zài gōngyuán lǐ zhòng shù.
    - We plant trees in the park.
  - 学校门口的老树被保护起来了(學校門口的老樹被保護起來了)。
    - Xuéxiào ménkǒu de lǎo shù bèi bǎohù qǐlái le.
    - The old tree at the school gate has been protected.
  - 公司要树立良好的形象(公司要樹立良好的形象)。
    - Gōngsī yào shùlì liánghǎo de xíngxiàng.
    - The company needs to establish a good image.
### 树叶(樹葉) → 树(樹) → 木(木)
- **definition:** wood; tree
- **pinyin:** mù
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** Pictogram (象形)
  - **description:** a tree: branches on top, roots on the bottom (more visible in earlier forms).
  - **interpretation:** Depicts a tree with spreading branches above and roots below, as seen clearly in early scripts. The vertical stroke is the trunk, while the short horizontal strokes became stylized limbs and roots in the regular form.
- **examples:**
  - 这张桌子是木头做的(這張桌子是木頭做的)。
    - Zhè zhāng zhuōzi shì mùtou zuò de.
    - This table is made of wood.
  - 山上长满了树木(山上長滿了樹木)。
    - Shān shang zhǎng mǎn le shùmù.
    - The mountainside is covered with trees.
  - 木材被运到工厂加工(木材被運到工廠加工)。
    - Mùcái bèi yùn dào gōngchǎng jiāgōng.
    - The timber was transported to the factory for processing.
### 树叶(樹葉) → 树(樹) → 又(又)
- **definition:** again; right hand
- **pinyin:** yòu
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** Pictogram – a right hand; original form of 右; unrelated to 𠬤 (> 译). Often written as 彐 in many modern characters (e.g., 事, 聿, 雪, 急, 爭, 尹, 建).
  - **interpretation:** Early graphs depict a right hand, which later gave rise to 右 ‘right (side)’. The adverbial sense ‘again’ developed later by semantic extension. In many compounds a similar shape is written as 彐, but that is a graphic convention rather than a direct historical component here.
- **examples:**
  - 他又来了(他又來了)。
    - Tā yòu lái le.
    - He came again.
  - 请向右转(請向右轉)。
    - Qǐng xiàng yòu zhuǎn.
    - Please turn right.
  - 她又买了一本书(她又買了一本書)。
    - Tā yòu mǎi le yī běn shū.
    - She bought another book.
### 树叶(樹葉) → 叶(葉)
- **definition:** leaf; foliage; (surname); classifier for leaves/petals
- **pinyin:** yè
- **components:**
  - 口
    - kǒu
    - mouth
  - 十
    - shí
    - ten
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** Phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** semantic: 口 + phonetic: 十 (ancient variant of 協); later borrowed to write 葉.
  - **interpretation:** Combines 口 as the semantic element and 十 as the phonetic, forming an old variant of 協 ‘to cooperate’. Due to homophony with 葉 in some Northern Wu varieties, this form was repurposed to write ‘leaf’ and was later standardized as the simplified character.
  - **simplification:** Adopted an existing, simpler variant 叶 (originally tied to 協) as the simplified form for 葉 because of homophony; it replaced 艹+枼 with 口+十.
- **examples:**
  - 秋天(秋天)，树上的叶子变黄了(樹上的葉子變黃了)。
    - Qiūtiān, shù shàng de yèzi biàn huáng le.
    - In autumn, the leaves on the trees turn yellow.
  - 这棵榕树的叶很大(這棵榕樹的葉很大)。
    - Zhè kē róngshù de yè hěn dà.
    - The leaves of this banyan tree are very large.
  - 她姓叶(她姓葉)，来自上海(來自上海)。
    - Tā xìng Yè, láizì Shànghǎi.
    - Her surname is Ye, and she is from Shanghai.
### 树叶(樹葉) → 叶(葉) → 口(口)
- **definition:** mouth
- **pinyin:** kǒu
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** Pictogram (象形) – resembles an open mouth.
  - **interpretation:** A simple square outlines the opening of a mouth, with the empty center representing the oral cavity. It later became a common semantic component indicating speech, sounds, or openings, and in early compounds sometimes marked abstract meanings via association or borrowing.
- **examples:**
  - 他张开口(他張開口)，说了几句(說了幾句)。
    - Tā zhāngkāi kǒu, shuō le jǐ jù.
    - He opened his mouth and said a few sentences.
  - 一家三口住在这个小城(一家三口住在這個小城)。
    - Yì jiā sān kǒu zhù zài zhège xiǎo chéng.
    - A family of three lives in this small town.
  - 她咬了一口苹果(她咬了一口蘋果)。
    - Tā yǎo le yì kǒu píngguǒ.
    - She took a bite of the apple.
### 树叶(樹葉) → 叶(葉) → 十(十)
- **definition:** ten
- **pinyin:** shí
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** phonetic loan (rebus)
  - **description:** Originally a vertical stroke later crossed by 一; possibly a pictogram of a needle, rebus-borrowed for the word ‘ten’.
  - **interpretation:** Early forms may have depicted a needle, and that form’s sound was repurposed to write the word for “ten.” The cross shape developed when a horizontal stroke was added to the original vertical line.
- **examples:**
  - 我有十个苹果(我有十個蘋果)。
    - Wǒ yǒu shí ge píngguǒ.
    - I have ten apples.
  - 现在是十点(現在是十點)。
    - Xiànzài shì shí diǎn.
    - It is ten o’clock now.
  - 我们十个人一起去(我們十個人一起去)。
    - Wǒmen shí ge rén yìqǐ qù.
