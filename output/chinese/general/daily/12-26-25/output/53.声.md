## 声(聲)
---
## sound; voice
### shēng
---
- **definition:** sound; voice
- **pinyin:** shēng
- **components:**
  - 耳
    - ěr
    - ear
  - 殸
    - qìng
    - stone chime; to sound (archaic)
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** phonetic 殸 + semantic 耳 (‘ear’).
  - **interpretation:** Combines 耳 “ear,” signaling a meaning related to hearing, with 殸 as the sound component guiding pronunciation. The graphic thus links the idea of hearing with a phonetic cue from the 殸 series, yielding the sense of sound/voice.
  - **simplification:** In simplification, the semantic ear 耳 was dropped and the graph was streamlined by adopting a reduced form of the phonetic component, yielding 声 with fewer strokes.
- **examples:**
  - 我听见奇怪的声响(我聽見奇怪的聲響)。
    - Wǒ tīngjiàn qíguài de shēngxiǎng.
    - I heard a strange sound.
  - 她的声音很温柔(她的聲音很溫柔)。
    - Tā de shēngyīn hěn wēnróu.
    - Her voice is very gentle.
  - 请小声一点(請小聲一點)。
    - Qǐng xiǎo shēng yīdiǎn.
    - Please lower your voice.
### 声(聲) → 耳(耳)
- **definition:** ear
- **pinyin:** ěr
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** pictogram: an ear
  - **interpretation:** Sketches the side view of a human ear: the vertical stroke outlines the rim while shorter strokes suggest inner folds. Early forms were more curved and naturalistic; later writing regularized the lines but the image remains recognizable.
- **examples:**
  - 他耳朵疼(他耳朵疼)。
    - Tā ěrduo téng.
    - His ear hurts.
  - 戴上耳机(戴上耳機)，听音乐(聽音樂)。
    - Dài shàng ěrjī, tīng yīnyuè.
    - Put on headphones and listen to music.
  - 医生检查他的左耳(醫生檢查他的左耳)。
    - Yīshēng jiǎnchá tā de zuǒ ěr.
    - The doctor examined his left ear.
### 声(聲) → 殸(殸)
- **definition:** stone chime; to sound (archaic)
- **pinyin:** qìng
- **components:**
  - 声(聲)
    - shēng
    - sound; voice
  - 殳
    - shū
    - weapon; club; to strike
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** ideogrammic compound
  - **description:** semantic: 声 ‘stone chime’ + semantic: 殳 ‘hand holding a hammer/mallet’ — a stone chime being struck.
  - **interpretation:** Combines the graph for a stone chime with a hand holding a striking tool to depict striking a lithophone. By extension it names both the instrument and the resonant sound produced when it is hit, paralleling forms like 鼓 where a drum is shown being beaten.
- **examples:**
  - 博物馆藏一件汉代殸(博物館藏一件漢代殸)。
    - Bówùguǎn cáng yī jiàn Hàn dài qìng.
    - The museum houses a Han-dynasty stone chime.
  - 祀典开始时(祀典開始時)，乐工以木槌击殸(樂工以木槌擊殸)。
    - Sìdiǎn kāishǐ shí, yuègōng yǐ mùchuí jī qìng.
    - At the start of the rite, the musicians strike the stone chime with wooden mallets.
### 声(聲) → 殸(殸) → 殳(殳)
- **definition:** weapon; club; to strike
- **pinyin:** shū
- **components:**
  - 又
    - yòu
    - again; right hand
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** Pictogram or ideogrammic compound
  - **description:** 𠘧 + 又 — a hand holding a tool similar to a hammer; associated with striking/activity; later borrowed phonetically for a bamboo halberd.
  - **interpretation:** Depicts a hand grasping a striking implement, conveying the idea of hitting or manual action. The graph was later reassigned by phonetic loan to name a bamboo halberd, while the original ‘strike/tool’ sense remains visible in its use as a radical.
- **examples:**
  - 殳姓很少见(殳姓很少見)。
    - Shū xìng hěn shǎo jiàn.
    - The surname Shu is very rare.
  - 古书中殳指一种竹制的戟(古書中殳指一種竹製的戟)。
    - Gǔshū zhōng shū zhǐ yī zhǒng zhúzhì de jǐ.
    - In ancient texts, 殳 refers to a kind of bamboo halberd.
  - 在甲骨文里(在甲骨文裏)，殳像手持工具的形状(殳像手持工具的形狀)。
    - Zài jiǎgǔwén lǐ, shū xiàng shǒuchí gōngjù de xíngzhuàng.
    - In oracle bone script, 殳 looks like a hand holding a tool.
### 声(聲) → 殸(殸) → 殳(殳) → 又(又)
- **definition:** again; right hand
- **pinyin:** yòu
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** Pictogram – a right hand; original form of 右; unrelated to 𠬤 (> 译). Often written as 彐 in many modern characters (e.g., 事, 聿, 雪, 急, 爭, 尹, 建).
  - **interpretation:** Early graphs depict a right hand, which later gave rise to 右 ‘right (side)’. The adverbial sense ‘again’ developed later by semantic extension. In many compounds a similar shape is written as 彐, but that is a graphic convention rather than a direct historical component here.
- **examples:**
  - 他又来了(他又來了)。
    - Tā yòu lái le.
    - He came again.
  - 请向右转(請向右轉)。
    - Qǐng xiàng yòu zhuǎn.
    - Please turn right.
  - 她又买了一本书(她又買了一本書)。
    - Tā yòu mǎi le yī běn shū.
