## 咏(詠)

## chant; eulogize
### yǒng
---
- **definition:** chant; eulogize
- **pinyin:** yǒng
- **components:**
  - 言
    - yán
    - speech; words
  - 口
    - kǒu
    - mouth; opening
  - 永
    - yǒng
    - eternal; forever
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** semantic: 言 + phonetic: 永
  - **interpretation:** Meaning comes from the speech element 言, while 永 provides the yǒng sound. In simplified, 口 replaces 言 but still signals vocalization, with 永 continuing to supply the pronunciation.
  - **simplification:** The semantic 言 was replaced by 口 to reduce strokes and emphasize mouth/vocalization, while retaining 永 as the phonetic; this aligns with simplification patterns that swap complex speech components for simpler ones.
- **examples:**
  - 他喜欢咏诗(他喜歡詠詩)。
    - Tā xǐhuan yǒng shī.
    - He likes to chant poetry.
  - 诗人以山水为题咏(詩人以山水為題詠)。
    - Shīrén yǐ shānshuǐ wéi tíyǒng.
    - The poet uses landscapes as themes for eulogizing.

    - Dàjiā qíshēng yǒngchàng zhè shǒu zàn gē.
    - Everyone chants this hymn in unison.
### 咏(詠) → 言
- **definition:** speech; words
- **pinyin:** yán
- **components:**
  - 舌
    - shé
    - tongue
  - 口
    - kǒu
    - mouth
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** ideogram
  - **description:** Ideogram: formed by adding a horizontal stroke to ancient 舌 to show tongue movement (speech). Shuowen erroneously treats it as phono-semantic: phonetic 䇂 (qiān) + semantic 口 (“mouth”).
  - **interpretation:** Built on 舌 (tongue), an added stroke marks motion, abstracting the act of speaking into a simple sign for “speech/words.” Later standardization added a dot on top and simplified the tongue shape, moving from a pictorial tongue to a conventional symbol for utterance. The Shuowen’s phono-semantic reading is a historical misinterpretation rather than the true origin.
- **examples:**
  - 请注意你的言语(請注意你的言語)。
    - Qǐng zhùyì nǐ de yányǔ.
    - Please mind your language.
  - 他发言很简短(他發言很簡短)。
    - Tā fāyán hěn jiǎnduǎn.
    - His remarks were brief.
  - 言行一致(言行一致)，方能取信于人(方能取信於人)。
    - Yán xíng yízhì, fāng néng qǔxìn yú rén.
    - Only by matching words with deeds can one gain others’ trust.
### 咏(詠) → 言 → 舌
- **definition:** tongue
- **pinyin:** shé
- **components:**
  - 口
    - kǒu
    - mouth
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** pictogram: a forked tongue emerging upwards from a mouth (口)
  - **interpretation:** Graph depicts a tongue sticking up from an open mouth, with the fork hinting at the split tip. Later forms stylized the drawing, but the mouth element remains visible at the bottom; it is unrelated to 舍.
- **examples:**
  - 医生让他伸出舌头检查(醫生讓他伸出舌頭檢查)。
    - Yīshēng ràng tā shēnchū shétou jiǎnchá.
    - The doctor asked him to stick out his tongue for an exam.
  - 辣得我舌头发麻(辣得我舌頭發麻)。
    - Là de wǒ shétou fā má.
    - It’s so spicy that my tongue is numb.
  - 紧张得他舌头打结了(緊張得他舌頭打結了)。
    - Jǐnzhāng de tā shétou dǎjié le.
    - He was so nervous that his tongue got tied.
### 咏(詠) → 言 → 舌 → 口
- **definition:** mouth
- **pinyin:** kǒu
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** Pictogram (象形) – resembles an open mouth.
  - **interpretation:** A simple square outlines the opening of a mouth, with the empty center representing the oral cavity. It later became a common semantic component indicating speech, sounds, or openings, and in early compounds sometimes marked abstract meanings via association or borrowing.
- **examples:**
  - 他张开口(他張開口)，说了几句(說了幾句)。
    - Tā zhāngkāi kǒu, shuō le jǐ jù.
    - He opened his mouth and said a few sentences.
  - 一家三口住在这个小城(一家三口住在這個小城)。
    - Yì jiā sān kǒu zhù zài zhège xiǎo chéng.
    - A family of three lives in this small town.
  - 她咬了一口苹果(她咬了一口蘋果)。
    - Tā yǎo le yì kǒu píngguǒ.
    - She took a bite of the apple.
### 咏(詠) → 永
- **definition:** eternal; forever
- **pinyin:** yǒng
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** pictogram of a long river with tributaries; alternatively, a person swimming in water; cognate with 𠂢, 派; original form of 泳.
  - **interpretation:** Depicts flowing water with branching streams or a swimmer moving through water, evoking continuity and unending motion. The watery sense later split: 泳 came to mean “to swim,” while 永 specialized to the idea of permanence and eternity.
- **examples:**
  - 我们永不放弃(我們永不放棄)。
    - Wǒmen yǒng bù fàngqì.
    - We will never give up.
  - 他发誓永远记得这一天(他發誓永遠記得這一天)。
