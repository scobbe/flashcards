- **definition:** talent; only then
- **pinyin:** cái
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** pictogram — a sharp peg; same as 弋 and 尗; see also the top component of 𢦏. Xu Shen erroneously analyzed it as a sprout.
  - **interpretation:** Originally depicted a sharp peg or stake, closely related to the forms 弋 and 尗. The modern senses “talent” and “only then” developed later through semantic extension and loan usage. Xu Shen’s sprout analysis reflects a visual misinterpretation rather than the historical form.
- **examples:**
  - 我刚到(我剛到)，他才开始(他才開始)。
    - Wǒ gāng dào, tā cái kāishǐ.
    - I just arrived, and only then did he start.
  - 她十八岁才学中文(她十八歲才學中文)。
    - Tā shíbā suì cái xué Zhōngwén.
    - She only started learning Chinese at eighteen.
  - 这孩子很有才(這孩子很有才)，写作特别好(寫作特別好)。
    - Zhè háizi hěn yǒu cái, xiězuò tèbié hǎo.
