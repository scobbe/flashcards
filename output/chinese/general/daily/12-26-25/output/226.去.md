  - **interpretation:** The character 大(dà) depicts a person facing forward, representing 'big' by suggesting the idea of someone standing prominently. Although often thought of as a person with outstretched arms, early scripts do not support this interpretation. It was originally the form of 夫(夫) (fū, 'man') and was later phonetically borrowed for the meaning 'big.'
