## 江山如画(江山如畫)
---
- **pinyin:** jiāngshān rúhuà
- **definition:** picturesque scenery
- **characters:**
  - 江
    - jiāng
    - river
  - 山
    - shān
    - mountain
  - 如
    - rú

  - 画(畫)
    - huà

- **etymology:** 江 (jiāng, "river") and 山 (shān, "mountain") act as a classical synecdoche for the entire realm (poetically, “江山” can mean the country itself), while 如 (rú, "like") 画(畫) (huà, "painting") invokes the literati landscape ideal where a scroll’s balanced composition and misty depth define true beauty. Calling the realm’s rivers and mountains “like a painting” praises scenery that seems artfully composed and harmonious—an aesthetic benchmark deeply rooted in Chinese landscape painting and political rhetoric about a flourishing land.
- **examples:**
  - 春雨过后(春雨過後)，江山如画(江山如畫)，游客络绎不绝(遊客絡繹不絕)。
    - chūn yǔ guò hòu, jiāngshān rúhuà, yóukè luòyì bù jué
    - After the spring rain, the landscape is picturesque, and tourists come in an endless stream.
