## 汤
---
- **pinyin:** tāng
- **definition:** soup
- **etymology:** 汤(湯) (tāng, "soup") is a phono-semantic compound: left side comes from 水 (shuǐ, "water") indicating liquid, while right-side 昜 (yáng, "to raise; rising") supplies the sound and suggests heat rising/boiling. The simplified form streamlines 昜 but preserves the idea of "hot water," hence "soup."
- **examples:**
  - 这碗鸡汤很鲜美(這碗雞湯很鮮美)，你要不要尝一口(你要不要嘗一口)？
    - Zhè wǎn jī tāng hěn xiānměi, nǐ yào bú yào cháng yì kǒu?
    - This bowl of chicken soup is really tasty—do you want to try a sip?
