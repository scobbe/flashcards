## 田
---
- **pinyin:** tián
- **definition:** field
- **etymology:** Pictograph of a cultivated plot: a square with a cross inside representing subdivided fields or irrigation furrows; early bronze and seal forms show the same layout. The image later standardized as 田 (tián, "field") and is not a phono-semantic compound—its meaning is conveyed directly by the picture.
- **examples:**
  - 雨停了(雨停了)，我们下田干活(我們下田幹活)。
    - Yǔ tíng le, wǒmen xià tián gàn huó.
    - The rain stopped, and we went into the fields to work.
  - 这片田已经收割完了(這片田已經收割完了)。
    - Zhè piàn tián yǐjīng shōugē wán le.
    - This field has already been harvested.
