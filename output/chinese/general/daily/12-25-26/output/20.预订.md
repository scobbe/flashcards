- **definition:** reserve; book
- **pinyin:** yùdìng
- **components:**
  - 预(預)
    - yù
    - in advance; beforehand; to anticipate; to prepare
  - 订(訂)
    - dìng
    - to order/book; to subscribe; to agree/fix; to revise/correct
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** compound word
  - **description:** 预(in advance) + 订(order/fix) = reserve/book
  - **interpretation:** Combines acting beforehand with fixing an arrangement, yielding the sense of securing something ahead of time. Commonly used for tickets, hotels, and services.
  - **simplification:** 預→预 simplifies by dropping the 頁 component and adopting the simpler 予 form; 訂→订 replaces the 言 radical with its simplified form 讠 while retaining 丁 as phonetic.
- **examples:**
  - 我想预订两张明天去上海的火车票(我想預訂兩張明天去上海的火車票)。
    - Wǒ xiǎng yùdìng liǎng zhāng míngtiān qù Shànghǎi de huǒchē piào.

### 预订 → 预(預)
- **definition:** in advance; beforehand; to anticipate; to prepare
- **pinyin:** yù
- **components:**
  - 予
    - yǔ
    - to give; I, me (archaic)
  - 页(頁)
    - yè
    - page; head
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** semantic: 頁 + phonetic: 予
  - **interpretation:** Combines 予 as the sound component with 頁 ‘head/page’ as the meaning component, evoking ideas kept in mind or arranged ahead of time. The sense naturally extends to anticipating, preparing, and doing things in advance, while 予 carries the pronunciation.
  - **simplification:** Simplified by replacing the semantic component 頁 with its simplified form 页 to reduce strokes, following the common component change 頁→页 while retaining the phonetic 予.
- **examples:**
  - 我们提前预约了酒店(我們提前預約了酒店)。
    - Wǒmen tíqián yùyuē le jiǔdiàn.
    - We made a hotel reservation in advance.
  - 项目预计下个月完成(項目預計下個月完成)。

### 预订 → 预(預) → 予
- **definition:** to give; I, me (archaic)
- **pinyin:** yǔ
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** rebus (phonetic loan)
  - **description:** Originally written as 呂 (OC *ɡ·raʔ), phonetically borrowed for “I; give”; later a 亅 was added as a distinguishing mark and the form was heavily stylized.
  - **interpretation:** Meaning was borrowed for its sound from 呂, a classic jiajie (phonetic loan). To avoid confusion with 呂, scribes appended a hook-like 亅 and the graph gradually simplified into its present shape.
- **examples:**
  - 依法予以处罚(依法予以處罰)。
    - Yīfǎ yǔyǐ chǔfá.
    - Punishment will be imposed according to the law.
  - 特此予以批准(特此予以批准)。

### 预订 → 预(預) → 页(頁)
- **definition:** page; head
- **pinyin:** yè
- **components:**
  - 首
    - shǒu
    - head; first
  - 卩
    - jié
    - seal; kneeling person
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** Pictogram (象形): 首 + 卩 – head of a kneeling person, emphasising “head”.
  - **interpretation:** Depicts a kneeling figure with the head highlighted, conveying the idea of 'head'. Later it was borrowed to write 'page/sheet' (via the popular form of 葉), while the original 'head' sense survives mainly in the radical and historical usage.
  - **simplification:** Simplified by adopting the cursive-derived graph 页 from 頁, reducing strokes for easier writing; meaning remained the same.
- **examples:**
  - 请翻到第三页(請翻到第三頁)。
    - Qǐng fān dào dì sān yè.

### 预订 → 预(預) → 页(頁) → 首
- **definition:** head; first
- **pinyin:** shǒu
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** Pictogram of an animal head with a long mouth and horns; later standardized from 𩠐 with hair 巛 simplified to 丷.
  - **interpretation:** Depicts a head seen from the front, with hair or mane on top and a protruding snout, which motivated the meaning ‘head’. As writing was regularized, the hair lines were reduced from 巛 to two dots 丷, and the sense broadened to ‘first’ in the sense of the foremost or leader.

### 预订 → 预(預) → 页(頁) → 卩
- **definition:** seal; kneeling person
- **pinyin:** jié
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** pictogram: a kneeling person from side view; similar but unrelated to 欠 and 女; see also 即; unrelated to 报.
  - **interpretation:** Depicts a person kneeling in profile, with the bent leg and upright torso stylized into the compact form. As a component it often signals the seal/kneeling-person radical in right-side positions, without implying any relation to look-alikes such as 欠 or 女.
- **examples:**
  - 古文字里，"卩"像侧身跪着的人(古文字裡，"卩"像側身跪著的人)。
    - Gǔ wénzì lǐ, "卩" xiàng cèshēn guìzhe de rén.
    - In ancient scripts, "卩" looks like a person kneeling in profile.
  - 在现代汉字中，卩多作部首，常放在字的右侧(在現代漢字中，卩多作部首，常放在字的右側)。
    - Zài xiàndài hànzì zhōng, jié duō zuò bùshǒu, cháng fàng zài zì de yòucè.
    - In modern Chinese characters, 卩 mostly functions as a radical, often placed on the right side.
  - 例如，即、却等字都含有卩(例如，即、卻等字都含有卩)。
    - Lìrú, jí, què děng zì dōu hányǒu jié.
    - For example, characters like 即 and 却 contain 卩.
### 预订 → 订(訂)
- **definition:** to order/book; to subscribe; to agree/fix; to revise/correct
- **pinyin:** dìng
- **components:**
  - 言
    - yán
    - speech; to speak
  - 丁
    - dīng
    - nail; fourth heavenly stem
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** semantic: 言 + phonetic: 丁; simplified from 訂 (訁 → 讠).
  - **interpretation:** Combines the speech element 言 with phonetic 丁 to cue the sound dìng and meanings tied to spoken agreements, ordering, and correction. In simplification, the speech radical was reduced to 讠 while 丁 remained, preserving pronunciation and core sense.
  - **simplification:** 訁 (speech radical) was simplified to 讠 in the left component to reduce strokes; the phonetic 丁 was unchanged.
- **examples:**
  - 我们订了两张机票(我們訂了兩張機票)。
    - Wǒmen dìng le liǎng zhāng jīpiào.
    - We booked two plane tickets.

### 预订 → 订(訂) → 言
- **definition:** speech; to speak
- **pinyin:** yán
- **components:**
  - 舌
    - shé
    - tongue
  - 口
    - kǒu
    - mouth
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** ideogram
  - **description:** Ideogram: formed by adding a horizontal stroke to ancient 舌 to show tongue movement (speech). Shuowen erroneously treats it as phono-semantic: phonetic 䇂 (qiān) + semantic 口 (“mouth”).
  - **interpretation:** Built on 舌 (tongue), an added stroke marks motion, abstracting the act of speaking into a simple sign for “speech/words.” Later standardization added a dot on top and simplified the tongue shape, moving from a pictorial tongue to a conventional symbol for utterance. The Shuowen’s phono-semantic reading is a historical misinterpretation rather than the true origin.
- **examples:**
  - 请注意你的言语(請注意你的言語)。
    - Qǐng zhùyì nǐ de yányǔ.
    - Please mind your language.
  - 他发言很简短(他發言很簡短)。
    - Tā fāyán hěn jiǎnduǎn.
    - His remarks were brief.
  - 言行一致(言行一致)，方能取信于人(方能取信於人)。
    - Yán xíng yízhì, fāng néng qǔxìn yú rén.
    - Only by matching words with deeds can one gain others’ trust.
### 预订 → 订(訂) → 言 → 舌
- **definition:** tongue
- **pinyin:** shé
- **components:**
  - 口
    - kǒu
    - mouth
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** pictogram: a forked tongue emerging upwards from a mouth (口)
  - **interpretation:** Graph depicts a tongue sticking up from an open mouth, with the fork hinting at the split tip. Later forms stylized the drawing, but the mouth element remains visible at the bottom; it is unrelated to 舍.
- **examples:**
  - 医生让他伸出舌头检查(醫生讓他伸出舌頭檢查)。
    - Yīshēng ràng tā shēnchū shétou jiǎnchá.
    - The doctor asked him to stick out his tongue for an exam.
  - 辣得我舌头发麻(辣得我舌頭發麻)。
    - Là de wǒ shétou fā má.
    - It’s so spicy that my tongue is numb.
  - 紧张得他舌头打结了(緊張得他舌頭打結了)。
    - Jǐnzhāng de tā shétou dǎjié le.
    - He was so nervous that his tongue got tied.
### 预订 → 订(訂) → 言 → 舌 → 口
- **definition:** mouth
- **pinyin:** kǒu
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** Pictogram (象形) – resembles an open mouth.
  - **interpretation:** A simple square outlines the opening of a mouth, with the empty center representing the oral cavity. It later became a common semantic component indicating speech, sounds, or openings, and in early compounds sometimes marked abstract meanings via association or borrowing.
- **examples:**
  - 他张开口(他張開口)，说了几句(說了幾句)。
    - Tā zhāngkāi kǒu, shuō le jǐ jù.
    - He opened his mouth and said a few sentences.

### 预订 → 订(訂) → 丁
- **definition:** nail; fourth heavenly stem
- **pinyin:** dīng
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** Pictogram (象形); different theories exist; see also 旦
  - **interpretation:** Often explained as the silhouette of a nail or spike, or a simple vertical post with a cap-like head. Its extremely simple form was later borrowed to label the fourth Heavenly Stem, and by administrative extension it came to denote an adult male for census/tax purposes.
- **examples:**
  - 甲乙丙丁是天干的前四位(甲乙丙丁是天干的前四位)。
    - Jiǎ Yǐ Bǐng Dīng shì tiāngān de qián sì wèi.
    - Jiǎ, Yǐ, Bǐng, Dīng are the first four of the Heavenly Stems.
