## 卫生(衛生)
---
- **pinyin:** wèishēng
- **definition:** hygiene
- **characters:**
  - 卫(衛)
    - wèi
    - guard
  - 生
    - shēng
    - life
- **etymology:** 卫(衛) (wèi, "guard") and 生 (shēng, "life") frame cleanliness as a defensive perimeter around vitality—practices that prevent the “invasion” of disease rather than repairing damage after it occurs. Pre-modern Chinese already used 衛生 for life-preserving regimens, and in the Meiji era this binome (via Japanese 衛生) was fixed to mean modern hygiene/public health, extending the old self-care ideal to systematic sanitation.
- **examples:**
  - 保持个人卫生很重要(保持個人衛生很重要)。
    - bǎochí gèrén wèishēng hěn zhòngyào
    - Maintaining personal hygiene is very important.
