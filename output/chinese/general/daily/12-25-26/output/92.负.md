## 负(負)
---
- **pinyin:** fù
- **definition:** carry on the back
- **etymology:** Oracle/bronze forms depict a person carrying valuables on the back; composed of 人 (rén, "person") above and 贝(貝) (bèi, "shell; money") below, visually showing bearing goods. Meaning broadened from literal "carry on the back" to "be indebted," since shells represented wealth/currency.
- **examples:**
  - 他负着孩子过河(他負著孩子過河)。
    - Tā fù zhe háizi guò hé.
    - He carried the child on his back across the river.
