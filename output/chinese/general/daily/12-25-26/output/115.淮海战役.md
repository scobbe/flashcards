- **etymology:** 淮 (huái, "Huai River") and 海 (hǎi, "sea") are a longstanding toponymic binome for the eastern lowlands from the Huai River basin to the Yellow Sea (as in 淮海平原), precisely the broad theater across southern Shandong and northern Jiangsu/Anhui where the fighting unfolded. 战(戰) (zhàn, "war") and 役 (yì, "campaign/service") form the fixed term for an operational-level campaign, so 淮海战役 names the large, multi-battle operation fought across that Huai–Sea region, matching the toponymic style of the 三大战役.
- **examples:**
  - 淮海战役是解放战争三大战役之一(淮海戰役是解放戰爭三大戰役之一)。
