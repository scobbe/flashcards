## 钱包(錢包)
---
- **pinyin:** qiánbāo
- **definition:** wallet
- **characters:**
  - 钱(錢)
    - qián
    - money
  - 包
    - bāo
    - bag
- **etymology:** 钱(錢) (qián, "money") signals the contents, while 包 (bāo, "to wrap; pouch") evokes a small, enclosed container—the character itself comes from the idea of wrapping—so the phrase literally means a money-wrap, i.e., the dedicated pouch for coins once tied at the waist. As those cloth sachets gave way to note holders and billfolds, 钱包 naturally persisted as the term for any container that ‘wraps’ one’s funds, now even extending to digital wallets.
- **examples:**
  - 我的钱包丢了(我的錢包丟了)，能帮我找找吗？(能幫我找找嗎？)。
    - wǒ de qiánbāo diū le, néng bāng wǒ zhǎo zhǎo ma?
    - I lost my wallet; could you help me look for it?
