### xiāo
---
- **definition:** deep and clear (literary); brisk
- **pinyin:** xiāo
- **components:**
  - 萧(蕭)
    - xiāo
    - mugwort; desolate; surname Xiao
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** semantic: 水 + phonetic: 蕭
  - **interpretation:** Water indicates a meaning related to water, clarity, or flowing qualities. 蕭 contributes the sound xiāo and shades the word’s literary feel as seen in uses like 潇洒 and 潇潇 (of rain).
  - **simplification:** Simplified by replacing the phonetic 蕭 with its simplified form 萧 while keeping the water component (氵), reducing strokes but preserving pronunciation.
- **examples:**
  - 他举止潇洒(他舉止瀟灑)。
    - Tā jǔzhǐ xiāosǎ.
    - His manner is free and graceful.
  - 夜里秋雨潇潇(夜裡秋雨瀟瀟)。
    - Yèlǐ qiūyǔ xiāoxiāo.
    - At night the autumn rain falls with a soughing sound.

    - Xiāoxiāng yīdài de fēngjǐng hěn měi.

### 潇(瀟) → 萧(蕭)
- **definition:** mugwort; desolate; surname Xiao
- **pinyin:** xiāo
- **components:**
  - 肖
    - xiào
    - resemble; likeness; surname
  - 肃(肅)
    - sù
    - solemn; respectful; serious
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** semantic: 艹 ‘grass’ + phonetic: 肖; in trad 蕭: semantic: 艹 + phonetic: 肅.
  - **interpretation:** Grass radical marks a plant, while 肖/肅 supplies the sound xiāo. The core sense refers to a kind of herb (mugwort), and from poetic usage it extends to bleak or desolate atmospheres, as in set phrases like 萧瑟 and 萧条.
  - **simplification:** The complex phonetic 肅 in 蕭 was replaced by the simpler, closer-sounding 肖, reducing strokes and regularizing the phonetic cue (cf. 箫 < 簫).
- **examples:**
  - 秋风萧瑟(秋風蕭瑟)。
    - Qiūfēng xiāosè.
    - The autumn wind is bleak.
  - 他姓萧(他姓蕭)。
    - Tā xìng Xiāo.

### 潇(瀟) → 萧(蕭) → 肖
- **definition:** resemble; likeness; surname
- **pinyin:** xiào
- **components:**
  - 小
    - xiǎo
    - small
  - 肉
    - ròu
    - meat; flesh
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** phonetic: 小; semantic: 肉 (“meat/flesh”).
  - **interpretation:** Combines the flesh component to signal the domain of body or appearance, while 小 supplies the sound. The sense ‘resemble/likeness’ likely arose from similarity in bodily features and later extended to portraits or images.
- **examples:**
  - 我们拥有肖像权(我們擁有肖像權).
    - Wǒmen yǒngyǒu xiàoxiàngquán.
    - We have the right to one’s portrait (portrait rights).
  - 这幅画的肖像很传神(這幅畫的肖像很傳神).

### 潇(瀟) → 萧(蕭) → 肖 → 小
- **definition:** small
- **pinyin:** xiǎo
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** pictogram: three small marks/dots representing smallness; later the dots elongated; Shuowen misread it as 会意: 八 + 丨.
  - **interpretation:** Three short strokes portray a tiny object or the idea of smallness. As the script evolved, the dots were drawn as short lines, which led to the later but incorrect analysis of 八 plus 丨.
- **examples:**
  - 这个苹果很小(這個蘋果很小)。
    - Zhège píngguǒ hěn xiǎo.
    - This apple is very small.
  - 他把字写得太小(他把字寫得太小)。
    - Tā bǎ zì xiě de tài xiǎo.

### 潇(瀟) → 萧(蕭) → 肖 → 肉

- **pinyin:** ròu
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** Pictogram: ribs/section of meat; stylized as 月 when beside a phonetic, and as 𱼀 or 夕 inside some characters.
  - **interpretation:** Depicts the cross-section of flesh with ribs or a slice of meat. In compounds it often appears as a component written like 月, or reduced to 𱼀/夕, which can be mistaken for the moon component but actually signals ‘meat/flesh.’
- **examples:**
  - 我不吃猪肉(我不吃豬肉)。
    - Wǒ bù chī zhūròu.
    - I don't eat pork.
  - 这道菜肉很多，很鲜嫩(這道菜肉很多，很鮮嫩)。

- **pinyin:** sù
- **components:**
  - 手
    - shǒu
    - hand
  - 聿
    - yù
    - writing brush
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** ideogrammic compound (會意)
  - **description:** 會意: 𦘒 ‘hand holding brush’ + 𣶒 ‘abyss’; uncertain interpretation (sweeping/walking with a staff near an abyss).
  - **interpretation:** Combines an image of a hand with a brush and an abyss to evoke careful, measured action at the edge of danger. The scene suggests restraint and reverence, yielding senses like solemn, respectful, and serious.
  - **simplification:** Mainland simplification reduced the complex strokes of 肅 to the compact form 肃 by graphic streamlining, likely drawing on cursive/clerical shorthand; meaning and pronunciation were preserved.
- **examples:**
  - 请保持肃静(請保持肅靜)。
    - Qǐng bǎochí sùjìng.
    - Please keep quiet.
  - 他的态度很严肃(他的態度很嚴肅)。

### 潇(瀟) → 萧(蕭) → 肃(肅) → 手
- **definition:** hand
- **pinyin:** shǒu
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** Pictogram: hand and fingers; five digits, with top stroke as bent middle finger and horizontal strokes as fingers.
  - **interpretation:** Depicts a human hand: the top stroke stands for a bent middle finger, and the horizontal strokes stand for the remaining fingers. In contrast to related claw forms that show three digits, it consistently presents a five‑finger human hand.
- **examples:**
  - 我手上有伤口(我手上有傷口)。
    - Wǒ shǒu shàng yǒu shāngkǒu.
    - I have a wound on my hand.
  - 请举起右手(請舉起右手)。

    - Tā dòngshǒu zuò fàn.

### 潇(瀟) → 萧(蕭) → 肃(肅) → 聿
- **definition:** writing brush
- **pinyin:** yù
- **components:**
  - 又
    - yòu
    - again; right hand
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram or ideogrammic compound
  - **description:** hand (又) holding a brush (𰀁); originally referred to 筆 ‘writing brush’; later jiajie (rebus) for 聿 ‘thereupon’.
  - **interpretation:** A right hand gripping a writing brush vividly depicts the act of writing. Its graph first named the brush itself and was later borrowed to represent the adverbial sense “thereupon/then” in classical usage.
- **examples:**
  - 古人以聿书竹帛(古人以聿書竹帛)。
    - Gǔrén yǐ yù shū zhúbó.
    - The ancients used a brush to write on bamboo and silk.
  - 他执聿临池练字(他執聿臨池練字)。

### 潇(瀟) → 萧(蕭) → 肃(肅) → 聿 → 又
- **definition:** again; right hand
- **pinyin:** yòu
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** Pictogram – a right hand; original form of 右; unrelated to 𠬤 (> 译). Often written as 彐 in many modern characters (e.g., 事, 聿, 雪, 急, 爭, 尹, 建).
  - **interpretation:** Early graphs depict a right hand, which later gave rise to 右 ‘right (side)’. The adverbial sense ‘again’ developed later by semantic extension. In many compounds a similar shape is written as 彐, but that is a graphic convention rather than a direct historical component here.
- **examples:**
  - 他又来了(他又來了)。
    - Tā yòu lái le.
    - He came again.
  - 请向右转(請向右轉)。
    - Qǐng xiàng yòu zhuǎn.
    - Please turn right.
  - 她又买了一本书(她又買了一本書)。
    - Tā yòu mǎi le yī běn shū.
