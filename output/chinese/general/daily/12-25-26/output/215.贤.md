- **definition:** virtuous; worthy
- **pinyin:** xián
- **components:**

- **etymology:**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** semantic: 貝 “money” + phonetic: 臤.
  - **interpretation:** 貝 signals the idea of value or treasure, pointing toward the sense of being worthy. 臤 provides the sound, while the combined sense evokes someone esteemed like money was in antiquity.
