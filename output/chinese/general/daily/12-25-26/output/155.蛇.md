## 蛇
---
- **pinyin:** shé
- **definition:** snake
- **etymology:** Phono-semantic compound: left side 虫 (chóng, "insect/worm") supplies the meaning of creeping/slithering creatures, while right side 它 (tā, "it") serves as the phonetic indicator from the same series. 虫 began as a pictograph of a wriggling segmented creature, visually fitting a snake.
