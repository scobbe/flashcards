## 话(話)
---
- **pinyin:** huà
- **definition:** speech; word; talk
- **etymology:** 话(話) (huà, "speech; talk") is a phono-semantic compound: left side 言 (yán, "speech") supplies the meaning, while right side 舌 (shé, "tongue") serves as the phonetic and also evokes speaking with the tongue. In simplified writing the speech element appears in its abbreviated form on the left, so the whole graph visually reads as 'words from the tongue'.
