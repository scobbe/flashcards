## 话(話)

## speech; word; talk
### huà
---
- **definition:** speech; word; talk
- **pinyin:** huà
- **components:**
  - 言
    - yán
    - speech; words
  - 舌
    - shé
    - tongue
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** semantic 言 (“word”) + phonetic 𠯑; right component not related to 舌.
  - **interpretation:** 言 indicates the meaning domain of speech and words, while 𠯑 provided the historical sound value. In the simplified form 话, the right side was swapped to 舌, which looks familiar but is not the original phonetic and only reflects later graphic regularization.
  - **simplification:** Simplified as 话 by changing 言 → 讠 and replacing the rare phonetic 𠯑 with the common component 舌 to reduce strokes and standardize shapes; the substitution is not etymologically based.
- **examples:**
  - 这句话很难懂(這句話很難懂)。
    - Zhè jù huà hěn nán dǒng.
    - This sentence is hard to understand.
  - 他说北京话(他說北京話)。
    - Tā shuō Běijīnghuà.
    - He speaks the Beijing dialect.
  - 别多说废话(別多說廢話)。
    - Bié duō shuō fèihuà.
    - Don't talk nonsense.
### 话(話) → 言
- **definition:** speech; words
- **pinyin:** yán
- **components:**
  - 舌
    - shé
    - tongue
  - 口
    - kǒu
    - mouth
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** ideogram
  - **description:** Ideogram: formed by adding a horizontal stroke to ancient 舌 to show tongue movement (speech). Shuowen erroneously treats it as phono-semantic: phonetic 䇂 (qiān) + semantic 口 (“mouth”).
  - **interpretation:** Built on 舌 (tongue), an added stroke marks motion, abstracting the act of speaking into a simple sign for “speech/words.” Later standardization added a dot on top and simplified the tongue shape, moving from a pictorial tongue to a conventional symbol for utterance. The Shuowen’s phono-semantic reading is a historical misinterpretation rather than the true origin.
- **examples:**
  - 请注意你的言语(請注意你的言語)。
    - Qǐng zhùyì nǐ de yányǔ.
    - Please mind your language.
  - 他发言很简短(他發言很簡短)。
    - Tā fāyán hěn jiǎnduǎn.
    - His remarks were brief.
  - 言行一致(言行一致)，方能取信于人(方能取信於人)。
    - Yán xíng yízhì, fāng néng qǔxìn yú rén.
    - Only by matching words with deeds can one gain others’ trust.
### 话(話) → 言 → 舌
- **definition:** tongue
- **pinyin:** shé
- **components:**
  - 口
    - kǒu
    - mouth
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** pictogram: a forked tongue emerging upwards from a mouth (口)
  - **interpretation:** Graph depicts a tongue sticking up from an open mouth, with the fork hinting at the split tip. Later forms stylized the drawing, but the mouth element remains visible at the bottom; it is unrelated to 舍.
- **examples:**
  - 医生让他伸出舌头检查(醫生讓他伸出舌頭檢查)。
    - Yīshēng ràng tā shēnchū shétou jiǎnchá.
    - The doctor asked him to stick out his tongue for an exam.
  - 辣得我舌头发麻(辣得我舌頭發麻)。
    - Là de wǒ shétou fā má.
    - It’s so spicy that my tongue is numb.
  - 紧张得他舌头打结了(緊張得他舌頭打結了)。
    - Jǐnzhāng de tā shétou dǎjié le.
    - He was so nervous that his tongue got tied.
### 话(話) → 言 → 舌 → 口
- **definition:** mouth
- **pinyin:** kǒu
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** Pictogram (象形) – resembles an open mouth.
  - **interpretation:** A simple square outlines the opening of a mouth, with the empty center representing the oral cavity. It later became a common semantic component indicating speech, sounds, or openings, and in early compounds sometimes marked abstract meanings via association or borrowing.
- **examples:**
  - 他张开口(他張開口)，说了几句(說了幾句)。
    - Tā zhāngkāi kǒu, shuō le jǐ jù.
    - He opened his mouth and said a few sentences.
  - 一家三口住在这个小城(一家三口住在這個小城)。
    - Yì jiā sān kǒu zhù zài zhège xiǎo chéng.
    - A family of three lives in this small town.
