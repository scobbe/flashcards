- **pinyin:** huòzhě
- **definition:** or; perhaps
- **characters:**
  - 或
    - huò
    - or; perhaps, maybe; some, someone
  - 者
    - zhě
    - one who, -er; person; that which, thing
- **etymology:** 或 (huò, "or; perhaps") plus 者 (zhě, "one who; that which") literally yields "some one/thing," marking indefiniteness. This "some → maybe" sense then grammaticalized into "perhaps" and extended to the disjunctive "or."
- **examples:**
  - 你可以坐地铁或者打车(你可以坐地鐵或者打車)。
    - Nǐ kěyǐ zuò dìtiě huòzhě dǎchē.
    - You can take the subway or take a taxi.
  - 或者他已经走了(或者他已經走了)。
    - Huòzhě tā yǐjīng zǒu le.
    - Perhaps he has already left.
