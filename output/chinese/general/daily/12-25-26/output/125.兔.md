## 兔
---
- **pinyin:** tù
- **definition:** rabbit
- **etymology:** 兔 (tù, "rabbit") originates as a pictograph of a rabbit: long ears and head above, a small tail, and the lower 儿 (ér, "child")-shaped legs depicting the hindquarters. Not a phono-semantic compound; later forms were adjusted to distinguish it from the similar 免 (miǎn, "avoid/exempt"), though both trace back to a rabbit drawing.
- **examples:**
  - 我属兔(我屬兔)，不吃兔肉(不吃兔肉)。
    - Wǒ shǔ tù, bù chī tù ròu.
    - I’m a Rabbit (in the Chinese zodiac), and I don’t eat rabbit meat.
