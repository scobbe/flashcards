## 水
---
- **pinyin:** shuǐ
- **definition:** water
- **etymology:** Ancient pictograph of flowing water: a central vertical stroke shows the main current, flanked by two sweeping strokes as side streams, with a dot suggesting a droplet/splash. A pure pictograph (not phono‑semantic) whose shape later served as the semantic water radical in many characters.
- **examples:**
  - 请给我一杯水(請給我一杯水)。
    - Qǐng gěi wǒ yì bēi shuǐ.
    - Please give me a glass of water.
