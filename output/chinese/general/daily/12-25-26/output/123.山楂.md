## 山楂
---
- **pinyin:** shānzhā
- **definition:** hawthorn
- **characters:**
  - 山
    - shān
    - mountain
  - 楂
    - zhā
    - hawthorn
- **etymology:** In Chinese plant names, 山 (shān, "mountain") flags a wild, upland habitat—and by extension a smaller, tarter, more medicinal profile—while 楂 (zhā, "hawthorn") names the tree/fruit, so 山楂 is literally the hawthorn of the mountains, distinguishing the rugged, sour North-China shrub used for digestion from sweeter, cultivated orchard fruits.
- **examples:**
  - 冬天街头常能买到用山楂做的糖葫芦(冬天街頭常能買到用山楂做的糖葫蘆)。
    - dōngtiān jiētóu cháng néng mǎi dào yòng shānzhā zuò de tánghúlu
    - In winter, you can often buy tanghulu made with hawthorn on the street.
