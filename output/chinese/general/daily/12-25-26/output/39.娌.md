## 娌
---
- **pinyin:** lǐ
- **definition:** wife of a younger brother
- **etymology:** Phono-semantic compound: 女 (nǚ, "woman")—a pictograph of a woman—gives the semantic field, while 里 (lǐ, "village; li") provides the sound lǐ. Combining "woman" with 里 evokes a woman within the household, specifically the wife of a younger brother.
- **examples:**
  - 我娌今天来家里做客(我娌今天來家裡做客)。
    - Wǒ lǐ jīntiān lái jiālǐ zuòkè.
