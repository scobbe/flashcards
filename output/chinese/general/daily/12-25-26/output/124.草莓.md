## 草莓
---
- **pinyin:** cǎoméi
- **definition:** strawberry
- **characters:**
  - 草
    - cǎo
    - grass
  - 莓
    - méi
    - berry
- **etymology:** 草 (cǎo, "grass") signals an herbaceous, ground-hugging plant whose fruit lies among the grass, while 莓 (méi, "berry") is the generic morpheme for small soft fruits—so “grass-berry” marks a berry borne by a low, non‑woody plant. This follows a Chinese habit of naming by growth form (cf. 木 (mù, "wood")/樹 (shù, "tree") + 莓 (méi, "berry") for woody cane berries) and even serendipitously echoes the straw/grass setting of the English “strawberry.”}.
- **examples:**
  - 我喜欢吃草莓(我喜歡吃草莓)。
    - wǒ xǐhuān chī cǎoméi
    - I like to eat strawberries.
