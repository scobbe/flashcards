## 冒
---
- **pinyin:** mào
- **definition:** emit; give off
- **etymology:** Depicts a cover over 目 (mù, "eye"), expressing the idea of covering or pressing on despite obstruction, which gave senses like "to act rashly" or "to face." By extension it came to mean "to protrude/come out; exude," hence "emit; give off."
