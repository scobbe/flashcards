## 寿(壽)
---
- **pinyin:** shòu
- **definition:** longevity
- **etymology:** Early forms of 寿(壽) (shòu, "longevity") depict an elder with a staff and a hand presenting an offering, symbolizing the bestowal of long life. In regular script it was reanalyzed into parts like 士 (shì, "scholar"), 口 (kǒu, "mouth"), 工 (gōng, "work"), with the bottom 寸 (cùn, "inch; hand/action") supplying the semantic idea of a hand conferring/measuring years. The simplified 寿 streamlines 壽 while retaining the visual cue of the hand element and its auspicious sense.
- **examples:**
  - 愿你长寿(願你長壽)。
    - Yuàn nǐ chángshòu.
    - May you live a long life.
  - 祝他寿比南山(祝他壽比南山)，福如东海(福如東海)。
    - Zhù tā shòu bǐ Nánshān, fú rú Dōnghǎi.
    - May his longevity be as great as the Southern Mountain, and his fortune as boundless as the Eastern Sea.
