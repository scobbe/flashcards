- **etymology:** In classical toponymy, 淮 (huái, "Huai River") and 海 (hǎi, "sea") form a meristic pair that delineates a swath of land “from the Huai to the coast,” a typical Chinese way to name regions by bracketing them with natural boundaries. 淮 evokes the historic north–south cultural watershed, while 海 points to the Yellow/East China Sea littoral, so 淮海 denotes the lower Huai basin and its adjoining coastal plain in eastern China.
