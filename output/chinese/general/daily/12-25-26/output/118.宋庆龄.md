- **etymology:** 宋 (sòng, "state/dynasty; surname") marks lineage from the ancient Song polity turned clan name, while 庆(慶) (qìng, "celebrate") + 龄(齡) (líng, "age") form an auspicious given name that literally ‘rejoices in years,’ i.e., a wish for honored longevity. In the Soong family, 龄(齡) also served as a generational character shared among the sisters, so 慶齡 both signals sibling cohort and embeds a parental blessing.
