## 艮
---
- **pinyin:** gèn
- **definition:** Gen trigram
- **etymology:** Oracle forms of 艮 (gèn, "Gen trigram; to stop, stubborn") depict a head/eye turned and fixed, conveying the ideas of "to stop" and "to stare," which aligns with the trigram’s sense of stillness like a mountain. It later serves mainly as a phonetic element in compounds such as 很 (hěn, "very") and 狠 (hěn, "vicious").

  - 在八卦中(在八卦中)，艮为山(艮為山)，象征停止与安静(象徵停止與安靜)。
    - Zài bāguà zhōng, gèn wéi shān, xiàngzhēng tíngzhǐ yǔ ānjìng.
    - In the Eight Trigrams, Gen is the mountain, symbolizing stopping and stillness.
