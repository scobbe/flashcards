## 功夫
---
- **pinyin:** gōngfu
- **definition:** kung fu
- **characters:**
  - 功
    - gōng
    - merit, credit; achievement, accomplishment; skill; efficacy
  - 夫
    - fū, fú
    - husband; man; worker, laborer; this, that (classical particle)
- **etymology:** 功 (gōng, "achievement; skill") combines with 夫 (fū, "man; worker")—here functioning as a suffix for 'effort/time'—to denote skill attained through sustained effort and time, later narrowed in English to martial arts.

    - Tā cóngxiǎo jiù xué gōngfu, xiànzài yǐjīng hěn lìhài le.
