## 三弦
---
- **pinyin:** sānxián
- **definition:** three-stringed Chinese lute used in Pingtan
- **characters:**
  - 三
    - sān
    - three
  - 弦
    - xián
    - string
- **etymology:** Named by the common instrument pattern where 三 (sān, "three") specifies the number of sounding elements and 弦 (xián, "string") works as a synecdoche for “stringed instrument,” so “three strings” straightforwardly marks the long‑necked lute distinguished by its three courses. In Suzhou 评弹 performance, this became the default accompaniment instrument, so 三弦 is understood as that particular three‑string lute (the Suzhou/mid-sized type) rather than any generic three‑string device.
- **examples:**
  - 在苏州的评弹表演中(在蘇州的評彈表演中)，三弦是不可或缺的伴奏乐器(三弦是不可或缺的伴奏樂器)。
