## 送秋波
---
- **pinyin:** sòng qiūbō

- **etymology:** 送 (sòng, "send") expresses the act of delivering, while 秋 (qiū, "autumn") and 波 (bō, "wave") evoke the classical image of limpid "autumn waves"—a metaphor for a beauty’s bright, rippling eyes—so it means to "send" alluring eye-waves, i.e., cast amorous glances.
