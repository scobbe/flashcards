- **definition:** character
- **etymology:** Graphs a child 子 (zǐ, "child") beneath a roof 宀 (mián, "roof"), picturing a child in the home and, by extension, the act of naming/education. Form is phono-semantic: 宀 provides the semantic setting of house/family, while 子 gives the sound (zì) and also contributes meaning.
