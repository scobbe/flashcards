## 懿
---
- **pinyin:** yì
- **definition:** virtuous
- **etymology:** Phono-semantic compound: 心 (xīn, "heart") supplies the semantic field of feelings/moral character, while 壹 (yī, "one; unity") serves as the phonetic and also hints at single-minded purity. The stacked form—壹 above 心—visually suggests a unified heart, yielding the sense of "virtuous, excellent."
