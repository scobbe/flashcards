## 声(聲)
---
- **pinyin:** shēng
- **definition:** sound; voice
- **etymology:** In 声(聲) (shēng, "sound; voice"), traditional 聲 is a phono-semantic compound with 耳 (ěr, "ear") as the semantic, indicating hearing, and 殸 (qìng, "stone chime; to strike a chime") as the phonetic that also depicts striking a chime to produce sound. The simplified form condenses the striking‑instrument image from 殸 and omits 耳, while preserving the meaning of sound/voice.
- **examples:**
  - 远处传来奇怪的声音(遠處傳來奇怪的聲音)，我赶紧关上了窗户(我趕緊關上了窗戶)。
    - Yuǎn chù chuán lái qí guài de shēng yīn, wǒ gǎn jǐn guān shàng le chuāng hù.
    - A strange sound came from the distance, and I quickly shut the window.
  - 她的声音很沙哑(她的聲音很沙啞)，但仍然温柔(但仍然溫柔)。
    - Tā de shēng yīn hěn shā yǎ, dàn réng rán wēn róu.
    - Her voice is hoarse, but still gentle.
