### 欺负(欺負) → 欺

- **pinyin:** qī
- **components:**
  - 其

    - its; that; such
  - 欠
    - qiàn
    - owe; lack; yawn
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** Phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** phonetic 其 (OC *kɯ, *ɡɯ) + semantic 欠 (“breath”)
  - **interpretation:** Combines 其 as the sound component with 欠 meaning ‘breath’ or ‘yawn,’ suggesting an action involving the mouth or utterance. The semantic idea of exhalation/speaking extended metaphorically to using words or power to take advantage of others, hence meanings like deceive and bully.
