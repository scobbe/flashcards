- **components:**

    - 10th Earthly Branch; wine vessel

  - **type:** Pictogram (象形)
  - **description:** A wine vessel with a pointed bottom; original character for 酒.
  - **interpretation:** It depicts a pointed-bottom wine vessel used in antiquity, which had to be set in a stand or into the ground. As the original graph for 酒 ‘alcohol’, it became associated with fermented beverages and later designated the tenth Earthly Branch.
- **examples:**
  - 现在是酉时(現在是酉時)。
    - Xiànzài shì yǒu shí.
    - It is the You hour (around 5–7 p.m.).

- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** Unorthodox variant of 單, original pictogram of a weapon, Y-shaped with two stones.
  - **interpretation:** The traditional form 單 originated as a pictogram representing a hunting weapon or tool with weights, useful for throwing or trapping. Over time, the representation was stylized and abstracted, eventually evolving into the simpler forms and additional meanings associated with the character today.

- **pinyin:** tián
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** Pictogram: pictographic representation of a field divided into four sections.
  - **interpretation:** Depicts a top-down view of a plot divided by paths or furrows, which naturally came to denote farmland. The square-with-cross motif also lent itself in some ancient contexts to a mask-like image, influencing related graphs.

### 酒单(酒單) → 单(單) → 十
- **definition:** ten
- **pinyin:** shí
- **etymology:**
  - **type:** phonetic loan (rebus)
  - **description:** Originally a vertical stroke later crossed by 一; possibly a pictogram of a needle, rebus-borrowed for the word ‘ten’.
  - **interpretation:** Early forms may have depicted a needle, and that form’s sound was repurposed to write the word for “ten.” The cross shape developed when a horizontal stroke was added to the original vertical line.
- **examples:**
  - 我有十个苹果(我有十個蘋果)。
    - Wǒ yǒu shí ge píngguǒ.
    - I have ten apples.
  - 现在是十点(現在是十點)。
    - Xiànzài shì shí diǎn.

- **etymology:**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** Pictogram (象形) – resembles an open mouth.
  - **interpretation:** A simple square outlines the opening of a mouth, with the empty center representing the oral cavity. It later became a common semantic component indicating speech, sounds, or openings, and in early compounds sometimes marked abstract meanings via association or borrowing.

    - Tā zhāngkāi kǒu, shuō le jǐ jù.
    - He opened his mouth and said a few sentences.
