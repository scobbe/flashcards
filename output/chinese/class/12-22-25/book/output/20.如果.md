## 如果(如果)
---
- **pinyin:** rúguǒ
- **definition:** if
- **characters:**
  - 如
    - rú
    - as, like; such as; in accordance with, according to; if
  - 果
    - guǒ
    - fruit; result, outcome; to bear fruit, to yield results; indeed, really
- **etymology:** 如  sets up a supposition—‘supposing it is so’(** 如  sets up a supposition—‘supposing it is so’),while 果  extends from ‘fruit’ to ‘outcome/actualization’(while 果  extends from ‘fruit’ to ‘outcome/actualization’), yielding the sense ‘if it actually turns out that…’. This reflects classical pairing of a conditional with a reality/result marker ,so 如果 naturally reads as ‘if’.
- **examples:**
  - 如果你有时间(如果你有時間)，我们就一起吃饭(我們就一起吃飯)。
    - rúguǒ nǐ yǒu shíjiān, wǒmen jiù yìqǐ chīfàn
    - If you have time, we'll eat together.
