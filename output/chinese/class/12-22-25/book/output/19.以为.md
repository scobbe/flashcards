## 以为(以為)
---
- **pinyin:** yǐwéi
- **definition:** to think (with more subjectivity)
- **characters:**
  - 以
    - yǐ

  - 为(為)
    - wéi, wèi
    - to do, act; to be, become, serve as; for, for the sake of; because of, due to
- **etymology:** 以 (yǐ, "to take; by means of") signals the act of mentally 'taking/adopting' something as a basis, while 为(為) (wéi, "to be; to deem") supplies the resulting status—hence the classical judgment pattern 以A為B "take A as B," later generalized to clause complements as "to think/assume." Because the stance rests on one’s own taking (以) rather than established fact, modern 以为 often carries a subjective—and frequently mistaken—shade of meaning.
