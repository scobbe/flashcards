- **etymology:** Both syllables are “flesh” characters:胳  is a northern bound morpheme that flags a body part and creates an euphonic disyllable(胳  is a northern bound morpheme that flags a body part and creates an euphonic disyllable),while 膊  supplies the specific referent—together literally ‘fleshy limb—upper arm(while 膊  supplies the specific referent—together literally ‘fleshy limb—upper arm),’ i.e., the arm.Historically alongside 胳臂  and 胳肢窝(Historically alongside 胳臂  and 胳肢窩),it reflects a Beijing/Northern pattern where 胳 marks ‘limb’ and 膊(it reflects a Beijing/Northern pattern where 胳 marks ‘limb’ and 膊),sharing the 肉  radical(sharing the 肉  radical),replaced 臂 to form the settled colloquial form.
