- **definition:** seriously ill
- **characters:**
  - 病

  - 重
    - zhòng/chóng
    - heavy, weighty; important, serious; to value, attach importance to; again, anew
- **etymology:** Treats illness as a weight: 病 (bìng, "illness; be sick") is the verb, 得 (de, "degree linker") introduces how severe that state is, and 很 (hěn, "very") + 重 (zhòng, "heavy; serious") invoke the long-standing Chinese scale of 重 vs 轻(輕) (qīng, "light") for gravity, so it literally reads “sick to a very heavy degree,” i.e., seriously ill.

  - 他病得很重(他病得很重)，需要马上住院(需要馬上住院)。
    - tā bìng de hěn zhòng, xū yào mǎ shàng zhù yuàn
