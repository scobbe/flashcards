## 把
---
- **pinyin:** bǎ
- **definition:** disposal marker
- **etymology:** Hand radical 扌 (pictograph of a hand) signals a manual action, combined with 巴 as phonetic (also ‘to cling’) to mean gripping/handle; this notion of taking hold motivates its grammatical use to mark disposal by foregrounding the affected object.
- **examples:**
  - 请把门关上(請把門關上)。
    - qǐng bǎ mén guān shàng
    - Please close the door.
