## 糟糕(糟糕)
---
- **pinyin:** zāo gāo
- **definition:** terrible
- **characters:**
  - 糟
    - zāo
    - dregs, lees; bad, wretched; marinated in wine lees, pickled; to marinate in wine lees
  - 糕
    - gāo
    - cake, pastry, rice cake
- **etymology:** Kitchen/brewing imagery underlies it: 糟 (zāo, "dregs; wretched") evokes the useless residue of brewing, and pairing it with 糕 (gāo, "rice cake")—a sticky grain lump—creates a rhyming, rice-radical echo that pictures an unappetizing clotted mess, hence “terrible.” In colloquial Mandarin the second syllable functions mainly as an echo‑intensifier chosen for sound and shared semantic field, not to literally mean “cake.”.
- **examples:**
  - 情况很糟糕(情況很糟糕)，我们得马上想办法(我們得馬上想辦法)。
    - qíngkuàng hěn zāo gāo, wǒmen děi mǎshàng xiǎng bànfǎ
    - The situation is terrible; we must think of a solution immediately.
