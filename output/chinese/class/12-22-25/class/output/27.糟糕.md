## 糟糕
---
- **pinyin:** zāo gāo
- **definition:** terrible
- **characters:**
  - 糟
    - zāo
    - dregs, lees; bad, wretched; marinated in wine lees, pickled; to marinate in wine lees
  - 糕
    - gāo
    - cake, pastry, rice cake
- **etymology:** Pairing the notion of dregs/bad with cake (a dense, congealed lump, both in the grain/food domain) conjures spoiled, pasty mash—an image of ruin that intensifies the sense of a situation being in a bad mess, hence “terrible.”
- **examples:**
  - 情况很糟糕(情況很糟糕)，我们得马上想办法(我們得馬上想辦法)。
    - qíngkuàng hěn zāo gāo, wǒmen děi mǎshàng xiǎng bànfǎ
    - The situation is terrible; we must think of a solution immediately.
