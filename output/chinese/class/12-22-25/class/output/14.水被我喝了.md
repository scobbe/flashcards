- **etymology:** 水 (shuǐ, "water") is topicalized as the affected entity, then 被 (bèi, "to cover; quilt") marks that it is 'covered/subject to' an external action by 我 (wǒ, "I"), with 喝 (hē, "drink") naming the action and 了 (le, "completed action") sealing its completion. Historically 被 shifted from the concrete sense of covering/suffering to a passive marker, so the sentence frames the event as 'the water came under my drinking (and it's done),' matching Chinese patient-first, topic–comment logic.
- **examples:**
  - 水被我喝了(水被我喝了)。
    - shuǐ bèi wǒ hē le
    - The water was drunk by me.
