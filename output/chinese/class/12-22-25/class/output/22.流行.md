## 流行
---
- **pinyin:** liú xíng
- **definition:** popular
- **characters:**
  - 流
    - liú
    - to flow; to spread, circulate; stream, current; class, type, grade
  - 行
    - xíng, háng
    - to go, to walk; to do, to carry out; OK, all right, permitted; row, line
- **etymology:** 流 (liú, "to flow; to spread") evokes a current sweeping outward, and 行 (xíng, "to go; to be in effect/acceptable") marks that the flow is actually practiced among people—together picturing an idea or fashion coursing through society. In Classical usage it described circulating diseases and customs (e.g., 流行病), later extending to trends and tastes—much like English "current"—hence "popular".
- **examples:**
  - 这首歌很流行(這首歌很流行)。
    - zhè shǒu gē hěn liú xíng
    - This song is very popular.
