## 手臂(手臂)
---
- **pinyin:** shǒu bì
- **definition:** arm
- **characters:**
  - 手
    - shǒu
    - hand; expert, adept; practitioner, player, competitor; move, trick
  - 臂
    - bì
    - arm; upper arm; arm, branch of a machine or structure
- **etymology:** 手 (shǒu, "hand") foregrounds the active manipulator, while 臂 (bì, "arm; upper arm; branch") names the supporting limb/branch, so together they denote the hand-bearing limb—the whole working unit from shoulder to fingers. Historically 臂 often meant just the upper arm, so prefacing it with 手 created a clear binome for the entire limb and reflects a functional view: the arm is the branch that serves the hand.
- **examples:**
  - 她的手臂受伤了(她的手臂受傷了)。
    - tā de shǒu bì shòu shāng le
    - Her arm is injured.
