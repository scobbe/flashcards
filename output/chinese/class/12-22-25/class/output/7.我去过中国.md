- **etymology:** 去 (qù, "go") marked by 过(過) (guò, "have experienced") turns "go" into "have gone (at least once)," with 中国(中國) (Zhōngguó, "China," lit. "central states") as the goal and 我 (wǒ, "I") as the experiencer. Because 过(過) originally means "pass/cross," placing it after a verb depicts the action as an experience one has "passed through" rather than a current act.
