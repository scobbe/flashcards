- **etymology:** 我 (wǒ, "I") is the agent, 把 (bǎ, "grasp; take") grammaticizes the act of taking hold of 水 (shuǐ, "water") as a definite patient to be disposed of, placing it before 喝 (hē, "drink") to foreground the water as the affected entity, while 了 (le, "completed change") seals the result—water gone by ingestion. Emerging from the older coverb meaning "take," 把 (bǎ) came to mark this patient‑focused, result‑oriented frame, so the sentence highlights the water’s change of state rather than merely the action of drinking.
- **examples:**
  - 我把水喝了(我把水喝了)。
