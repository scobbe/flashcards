- **etymology:** 我 (wǒ, "I") as subject performs 吃 (chī, "eat") on 早 (zǎo, "morning/early") + 饭(飯) (fàn, "cooked rice; meal"), where 早 names the time of day and 饭, historically "cooked rice," stands metonymically for a meal (hence the series 早/午/晚 + 饭). The postverbal 了 (le, "perfective aspect") marks the action as completed rather than merely past, so it literally reads "I eat-completed the morning meal," yielding "I ate breakfast.".
