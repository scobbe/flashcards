## 电动车(電動車)
---
- **pinyin:** diàn dòng chē
- **definition:** electric vehicle
- **characters:**
  - 电(電)
    - diàn
    - electricity; electric, electrical; lightning
  - 动(動)
    - dòng
    - to move; to touch, stir (emotionally); to use, employ; to start, set in motion
  - 车(車)
    - chē
    - vehicle, car; Chinese chess rook
- **etymology:** 电(電) (diàn, "electricity") marks the energy source while 动(動) (dòng, "to move; set in motion") is reinterpreted attributively as "driven/actuated," yielding 电动 "motion by electricity"; adding 车(車) (chē, "vehicle") makes the head noun explicit: a vehicle whose movement is powered by electricity. This mirrors a modern industrial X+动 pattern for "X-driven" (spread via Sino-Japanese technical coinages like 電動), which is why 电动车 neatly contrasts with fuel-powered vehicles.
- **examples:**
  - 我打算买一辆电动车(我打算買一輛電動車)。
    - wǒ dǎsuàn mǎi yí liàng diàn dòng chē
    - I plan to buy an electric vehicle.
