## 买不起(買不起)
---
- **pinyin:** mǎi bù qǐ
- **definition:** cannot afford
- **characters:**
  - 买(買)
    - mǎi
    - to buy, purchase; to bribe, buy off
  - 不
    - bù
    - not, no; negative prefix un-, non-
  - 起
    - qǐ
    - to rise, get up; to start, begin; to raise, lift; classifier for occurrences, cases
- **etymology:** 买(買) (mǎi, "to buy") + 不 (bù, "not") + 起 (qǐ, "to rise; to lift") uses 起 as a potential/resultative complement: paying a price is conceptualized as ‘lifting/raising up to’ a financial threshold, and failing to raise it means the purchase cannot be completed—hence “cannot afford.” The same upward-threshold metaphor appears in pairs like 买得起/买不起 and 看得起/看不起, where 起 marks whether one can reach up to the required level (funds, esteem).
- **examples:**
  - 这辆车太贵了(這輛車太貴了)，我买不起(我買不起)。
    - zhè liàng chē tài guì le, wǒ mǎi bù qǐ
    - This car is too expensive; I can’t afford it.
