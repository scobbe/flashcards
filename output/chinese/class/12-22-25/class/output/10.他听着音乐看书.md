- **etymology:** In the V1着O1 V2 O2 serial-verb frame, 听(聽) (tīng, "listen") + 着(著) (zhe, "durative") presents listening as an ongoing backdrop—著’s older sense "attach, stick" makes it a state that clings to the subject. That attached state modifies the foregrounded action 看 (kàn, "look/read") 书(書) (shū, "book"), with 音 (yīn, "sound") + 乐(樂) (yuè, "music") as the object of listening, yielding “he reads with music in his ears,” i.e., reads while listening to music.
