## 度假
---
- **pinyin:** dù jià
- **definition:** to go on vacation
- **characters:**
  - 度
    - dù; duó
    - degree; extent, measure; to spend, pass (time); to estimate, gauge
  - 假
    - jiǎ; jià
    - fake, false; to pretend, feign; to borrow; vacation, holiday, leave
- **etymology:** 度 (dù, "to spend, pass [time]") is the verb seen in 度日/度歲, and 假 (jià, "leave, vacation") developed from the bureaucratic notion of a granted temporary absence from duty; together they mean “to pass one’s leave,” i.e., to spend the period officially away from work—hence ‘to go on vacation.’.
- **examples:**
  - 我们打算明年夏天去海南度假(我們打算明年夏天去海南度假)。
    - wǒmen dǎsuàn míngnián xiàtiān qù hǎinán dùjià
    - We plan to go to Hainan for vacation.

## 他听着音乐看书(他聽著音樂看書)
---
- **pinyin:** tā tīng zhe yīn yuè kàn shū
- **definition:** He reads while listening to music
- **characters:**
  - 他
    - tā
    - he, him; it; other, another
  - 听(聽)
    - tīng
    - listen; hear; obey
  - 着(著)
    - zhe
    - durative aspect particle; to catch, become affected; to wear, put on; to attach, stick
  - 音
    - yīn
    - sound; tone; news, information
  - 乐(樂)
    - yuè
    - music; happy, joyful; enjoy, take pleasure in
  - 看
    - kàn
    - see; look at, watch; read; visit
  - 书(書)
    - shū
    - book; letter, document; writing; calligraphy
- **etymology:** In the V1着O1 V2 O2 serial-verb frame, 听(聽) (tīng, "listen") + 着(著) (zhe, "durative") presents listening as an ongoing backdrop—著’s older sense "attach, stick" makes it a state that clings to the subject. That attached state modifies the foregrounded action 看 (kàn, "look/read") 书(書) (shū, "book"), with 音 (yīn, "sound") + 乐(樂) (yuè, "music") as the object of listening, yielding “he reads with music in his ears,” i.e., reads while listening to music.
- **examples:**
  - 他听着音乐看书(他聽著音樂看書)。
    - tā tīng zhe yīn yuè kàn shū
    - He reads while listening to music.
  - 他听着音乐看书(他聽著音樂看書)，心情放松(心情放鬆)。
    - tā tīng zhe yīn yuè kàn shū, xīn qíng fàng sōng

## 我把水喝了
---
- **pinyin:** wǒ bǎ shuǐ hē le
- **definition:** I drank the water
- **characters:**
  - 我
    - wǒ
    - I, me; self, ego
  - 把
    - bǎ
    - to hold, grasp; handle; measure word for things with a handle, handfuls; BA construction particle marking disposal
  - 水
    - shuǐ
    - water; liquid, fluid; river, waterway; watery, dilute
  - 喝
    - hē, hè
    - to drink; to shout, scold
  - 了
    - le, liǎo
    - particle indicating completed action or change; to finish, end; to be able to, manage
- **etymology:** 我 (wǒ, "I") is the agent, 把 (bǎ, "grasp; take") grammaticizes the act of taking hold of 水 (shuǐ, "water") as a definite patient to be disposed of, placing it before 喝 (hē, "drink") to foreground the water as the affected entity, while 了 (le, "completed change") seals the result—water gone by ingestion. Emerging from the older coverb meaning "take," 把 (bǎ) came to mark this patient‑focused, result‑oriented frame, so the sentence highlights the water’s change of state rather than merely the action of drinking.
- **examples:**
  - 我把水喝了(我把水喝了)。
    - wǒ bǎ shuǐ hē le
    - I drank the water.

## 水被我喝了
---
- **pinyin:** shuǐ bèi wǒ hē le
- **definition:** The water was drunk by me
- **characters:**
  - 水
    - shuǐ
    - water; liquid; river; moisture
  - 被
    - bèi
    - by (passive marker); quilt, blanket; to cover
  - 我
    - wǒ
    - I, me; my
  - 喝
    - hē
    - to drink
  - 了
    - le
    - particle indicating completed action; particle indicating change of state
- **etymology:** 水 (shuǐ, "water") is topicalized as the affected entity, then 被 (bèi, "to cover; quilt") marks that it is 'covered/subject to' an external action by 我 (wǒ, "I"), with 喝 (hē, "drink") naming the action and 了 (le, "completed action") sealing its completion. Historically 被 shifted from the concrete sense of covering/suffering to a passive marker, so the sentence frames the event as 'the water came under my drinking (and it's done),' matching Chinese patient-first, topic–comment logic.
- **examples:**
  - 水被我喝了(水被我喝了)。
    - shuǐ bèi wǒ hē le
    - The water was drunk by me.

## 伤心(傷心)
---
- **pinyin:** shāng xīn
- **definition:** sad
- **characters:**
  - 伤(傷)
    - shāng
    - to injure, hurt; to damage, impair; wound, injury; to sadden, grieve
  - 心
    - xīn
    - heart (organ); heart, mind, feelings; intention, thought; core, center
- **etymology:** Rooted in the classical view that 心 (xīn, "heart; mind") is the seat of feeling and thought, 伤(傷) (shāng, "to injure; to grieve") frames sadness as a literal wound to that inner organ—a long-standing metaphor in literature and traditional medicine (“emotions injure the heart”)—so 伤心 conveys heartbreak as damage to one’s emotional core rather than a fleeting mood.
- **examples:**
  - 听到这个消息(聽到這個消息)，我很伤心(我很傷心)。
    - tīng dào zhège xiāo xī, wǒ hěn shāng xīn
    - I was very sad to hear the news.
  - 别伤心(別傷心)，我们会一起想办法(我們會一起想辦法)。
    - bié shāng xīn, wǒmen huì yìqǐ xiǎng bànfǎ

## 受伤了(受傷了)
---
- **pinyin:** shòu shāng le
- **definition:** got injured
- **characters:**
  - 受
    - shòu
    - receive, accept; suffer, undergo; be affected by; endure, bear
  - 伤(傷)
    - shāng
    - wound, injury; to injure, hurt; to damage, harm; sorrow, grief
  - 了
    - le
    - perfective aspect particle indicating completed action; sentence-final particle indicating change of state, new situation
- **etymology:** 受 (shòu, "receive; suffer") casts harm as something passively undergone while 傷 (shāng, "wound; to injure") names the blow, yielding 受傷 as “to receive injury,” a long-standing pattern where 受 marks the patient of an external force. 了 (le, "change-of-state/completion particle") flags that this has now occurred, shifting the situation to “got injured.”.
- **examples:**
  - 他在比赛中受伤了(他在比賽中受傷了)。
    - tā zài bǐsài zhōng shòu shāng le
    - He got injured during the match.
  - 别动(別動)，医生说你受伤了(醫生說你受傷了)，还需要休息(還需要休息)。
    - bié dòng, yīshēng shuō nǐ shòu shāng le, hái xūyào xiūxi

## 重要
---
- **pinyin:** zhòng yào
- **definition:** important
- **characters:**
  - 重
    - zhòng, chóng
    - heavy, weighty; important, significant; weight; again, repeatedly
  - 要
    - yào, yāo
    - to want, desire; to need, require; will, be going to; important, essential
- **etymology:** 重 (zhòng, "heavy; weighty") draws on the age-old metaphor of physical weight for seriousness and value, while 要 (yào, "essential; to require") denotes what is vital or a strategic key point (as in 要地). Together they picture a weighty essential at a crucial node, yielding the sense of importance.
- **examples:**
  - 这件事很重要(這件事很重要)。
    - zhè jiàn shì hěn zhòng yào
    - This matter is very important.

## 病得很重
---
- **pinyin:** bìng de hěn zhòng
- **definition:** seriously ill
- **characters:**
  - 病
    - bìng
    - illness, disease; to be sick, fall ill; fault, defect
  - 得
    - dé/děi/de
    - to obtain, get; must, have to; structural particle linking a verb with its complement of degree or result
  - 很
    - hěn
    - very, quite
  - 重
    - zhòng/chóng
    - heavy, weighty; important, serious; to value, attach importance to; again, anew
- **etymology:** Treats illness as a weight: 病 (bìng, "illness; be sick") is the verb, 得 (de, "degree linker") introduces how severe that state is, and 很 (hěn, "very") + 重 (zhòng, "heavy; serious") invoke the long-standing Chinese scale of 重 vs 轻(輕) (qīng, "light") for gravity, so it literally reads “sick to a very heavy degree,” i.e., seriously ill.
- **examples:**
  - 他病得很重(他病得很重)，需要马上住院(需要馬上住院)。
    - tā bìng de hěn zhòng, xū yào mǎ shàng zhù yuàn
    - He is seriously ill and needs to be hospitalized immediately.

## 手臂
---
- **pinyin:** shǒu bì
- **definition:** arm
- **characters:**
  - 手
    - shǒu
    - hand; expert, adept; practitioner, player, competitor; move, trick
  - 臂
    - bì
    - arm; upper arm; arm, branch of a machine or structure
- **etymology:** 手 (shǒu, "hand") foregrounds the active manipulator, while 臂 (bì, "arm; upper arm; branch") names the supporting limb/branch, so together they denote the hand-bearing limb—the whole working unit from shoulder to fingers. Historically 臂 often meant just the upper arm, so prefacing it with 手 created a clear binome for the entire limb and reflects a functional view: the arm is the branch that serves the hand.
- **examples:**
  - 她的手臂受伤了(她的手臂受傷了)。
    - tā de shǒu bì shòu shāng le
    - Her arm is injured.

## 对来说(對來說)
---
- **pinyin:** duì … lái shuō
- **definition:** as for; with regard to
- **characters:**
  - 对(對)
    - duì
    - correct, right; to, toward, regarding; pair, couple; to face, be opposite
  - 来(來)
    - lái
    - come, arrive; next, coming; approximately, about (after numerals)
  - 说(說)
    - shuō
    - to speak, say; to explain, account for; to scold, criticize; theory, doctrine
- **etymology:** 对(對) (duì, "toward; regarding") sets up the side one is literally “facing,” i.e., the target perspective, while 来(來) (lái, "come") + 说(說) (shuō, "speak") is a fossilized light-verb frame meaning “in speaking as it comes/approaches,” so 对…来说 reads as “speaking from the side of X.” Echoing the classical 於…言 pattern, it encodes evaluation as something directed toward X and then articulated—hence “as for; with regard to.”.
- **examples:**
  - 对我来说(對我來說)，这个问题很重要(這個問題很重要)。
    - duì wǒ lái shuō, zhège wèntí hěn zhòngyào
    - As for me, this issue is very important.
  - 对外国人来说(對外國人來說)，中文发音不太容易(中文發音不太容易)。

## 大腿
---
- **pinyin:** dà tuǐ
- **definition:** thigh
- **characters:**
  - 大
    - dà
    - big, large; great, major, main; eldest, oldest; adult, grown-up
  - 腿
    - tuǐ
    - leg, thigh; leg of furniture, support
- **etymology:** 大 (dà, "big") marks the leg's thicker, weight-bearing upper section in the common 大/小 partition of a whole, while 腿 (tuǐ, "leg") names the limb, together denoting the leg's big part: the thigh. Classical 股 (gǔ, "thigh") exists, but vernacular favored this transparent contrast with 小 (xiǎo, "small") in 小腿 (xiǎo tuǐ, "calf"), making 大腿 the natural counterpart.
- **examples:**
  - 他的大腿受伤了(他的大腿受傷了)。
    - tā de dà tuǐ shòu shāng le
    - He injured his thigh.
  - 跑完马拉松后(跑完馬拉松後)，我的大腿很酸痛(我的大腿很酸痛)。
    - pǎo wán mǎlāsōng hòu wǒ de dà tuǐ hěn suān tòng
    - After finishing the marathon, my thighs are very sore.

## 小腿
---
- **pinyin:** xiǎo tuǐ
- **definition:** lower leg; calf
- **characters:**
  - 小
    - xiǎo
    - small, little; young; minor, petty
  - 腿
    - tuǐ
    - leg; leg of a table, furniture leg; drumstick, leg meat, ham
- **etymology:** 小 (xiǎo, "small") marks the lesser segment within a natural pair, so 小腿 specifies the narrower, distal part of 腿 (tuǐ, "leg") below the knee, contrasted with 大 (dà, "big") + 腿 for the thigh. This size-based anatomical partition (cf. classical 胫 for “shin”) underlies colloquial formations like 小腿肚 for the calf muscle.
- **examples:**
  - 他的小腿被划伤了(他的小腿被劃傷了)。
    - tā de xiǎo tuǐ bèi huá shāng le
    - His lower leg was cut.
  - 跑步后(跑步後)，我的小腿很酸(我的小腿很酸)。
    - pǎo bù hòu, wǒ de xiǎo tuǐ hěn suān
    - After running, my calves are very sore.

## 流行
---
- **pinyin:** liú xíng
- **definition:** popular
- **characters:**
  - 流
    - liú
    - to flow; to spread, circulate; stream, current; class, type, grade
  - 行
    - xíng, háng
    - to go, to walk; to do, to carry out; OK, all right, permitted; row, line
- **etymology:** 流 (liú, "to flow; to spread") evokes a current sweeping outward, and 行 (xíng, "to go; to be in effect/acceptable") marks that the flow is actually practiced among people—together picturing an idea or fashion coursing through society. In Classical usage it described circulating diseases and customs (e.g., 流行病), later extending to trends and tastes—much like English "current"—hence "popular".
- **examples:**
  - 这首歌很流行(這首歌很流行)。
    - zhè shǒu gē hěn liú xíng
    - This song is very popular.

## 电动车(電動車)
---
- **pinyin:** diàn dòng chē
- **definition:** electric vehicle
- **characters:**
  - 电(電)
    - diàn
    - electricity; electric, electrical; lightning
  - 动(動)
    - dòng
    - to move; to touch, stir (emotionally); to use, employ; to start, set in motion
  - 车(車)
    - chē
    - vehicle, car; Chinese chess rook
- **etymology:** 电(電) (diàn, "electricity") marks the energy source while 动(動) (dòng, "to move; set in motion") is reinterpreted attributively as "driven/actuated," yielding 电动 "motion by electricity"; adding 车(車) (chē, "vehicle") makes the head noun explicit: a vehicle whose movement is powered by electricity. This mirrors a modern industrial X+动 pattern for "X-driven" (spread via Sino-Japanese technical coinages like 電動), which is why 电动车 neatly contrasts with fuel-powered vehicles.
- **examples:**
  - 我打算买一辆电动车(我打算買一輛電動車)。
    - wǒ dǎsuàn mǎi yí liàng diàn dòng chē
    - I plan to buy an electric vehicle.

## 买不起(買不起)
---
- **pinyin:** mǎi bù qǐ
- **definition:** cannot afford
- **characters:**
  - 买(買)
    - mǎi
    - to buy, purchase; to bribe, buy off
  - 不
    - bù
    - not, no; negative prefix un-, non-
  - 起
    - qǐ
    - to rise, get up; to start, begin; to raise, lift; classifier for occurrences, cases
- **etymology:** 买(買) (mǎi, "to buy") + 不 (bù, "not") + 起 (qǐ, "to rise; to lift") uses 起 as a potential/resultative complement: paying a price is conceptualized as ‘lifting/raising up to’ a financial threshold, and failing to raise it means the purchase cannot be completed—hence “cannot afford.” The same upward-threshold metaphor appears in pairs like 买得起/买不起 and 看得起/看不起, where 起 marks whether one can reach up to the required level (funds, esteem).
- **examples:**
  - 这辆车太贵了(這輛車太貴了)，我买不起(我買不起)。
    - zhè liàng chē tài guì le, wǒ mǎi bù qǐ
    - This car is too expensive; I can’t afford it.

## 二手车(二手車)
---
- **pinyin:** è r shǒu chē
- **definition:** used car
- **characters:**
  - 二
    - èr
    - two; second; double; foolish, silly (slang)
  - 手
    - shǒu
    - hand; expert, ace; method, technique; move (in games)
  - 车(車)
    - chē
    - vehicle, car; to turn on a lathe, to mill
- **etymology:** 二 (èr, "second") marks one remove from the source, and 手 (shǒu, "hand") is the metonym for ownership/transfer—as in 轉手/過手 and the contrast 一手/二手—so 车(車) (chē, "vehicle") that has already changed hands once is a previously owned car.
- **examples:**
  - 我打算买一辆二手车(我打算買一輛二手車)，因为预算有限(因為預算有限)。
    - wǒ dǎsuàn mǎi yí liàng èrshǒuchē, yīnwèi yùsuàn yǒuxiàn
    - I plan to buy a used car because my budget is limited.
  - 这家店只卖认证过的二手车(這家店只賣認證過的二手車)，车况有保障(車況有保障)。

## 等着(等著)
---
- **pinyin:** děng zhe
- **definition:** waiting
- **characters:**
  - 等
    - děng
    - to wait for; equal, same; class, rank, grade; and so on, etc.
  - 着(著)
    - zhe/zháo/zhuó
    - durative aspect particle indicating ongoing action or state; to touch, make contact; to succeed, manage to (after a verb); to put on, wear, apply, attach
- **etymology:** 等 (děng, "to wait; equal") supplies the act, while 着(著) (zhe, "durative; originally 'to touch/attach'") turns it into a state you remain attached to—waiting as something you’re stuck on until the awaited thing arrives. The particle’s roots in physical contact grammaticalized into continuity, so 等着 denotes sustained, ongoing waiting rather than a momentary pause.
- **examples:**
  - 你先等着(你先等著)，我马上回来(我馬上回來)。
    - nǐ xiān děng zhe, wǒ mǎshàng huí lái
    - Just wait for now; I'll be right back.
  - 我们在门口等着你(我們在門口等著你)。

## 糟糕
---
- **pinyin:** zāo gāo
- **definition:** terrible
- **characters:**
  - 糟
    - zāo
    - dregs, lees; bad, wretched; marinated in wine lees, pickled; to marinate in wine lees
  - 糕
    - gāo
    - cake, pastry, rice cake
- **etymology:** Kitchen/brewing imagery underlies it: 糟 (zāo, "dregs; wretched") evokes the useless residue of brewing, and pairing it with 糕 (gāo, "rice cake")—a sticky grain lump—creates a rhyming, rice-radical echo that pictures an unappetizing clotted mess, hence “terrible.” In colloquial Mandarin the second syllable functions mainly as an echo‑intensifier chosen for sound and shared semantic field, not to literally mean “cake.”.
- **examples:**
  - 情况很糟糕(情況很糟糕)，我们得马上想办法(我們得馬上想辦法)。
    - qíngkuàng hěn zāo gāo, wǒmen děi mǎshàng xiǎng bànfǎ
    - The situation is terrible; we must think of a solution immediately.

  - 了
    - le
    - aspect particle indicating completed action; modal particle indicating change of state, now, already
  - 早
    - zǎo
    - early; morning; in advance, beforehand
  - 饭(飯)
    - fàn
    - cooked rice; meal, food
- **etymology:** 我 (wǒ, "I") as subject performs 吃 (chī, "eat") on 早 (zǎo, "morning/early") + 饭(飯) (fàn, "cooked rice; meal"), where 早 names the time of day and 饭, historically "cooked rice," stands metonymically for a meal (hence the series 早/午/晚 + 饭). The postverbal 了 (le, "perfective aspect") marks the action as completed rather than merely past, so it literally reads "I eat-completed the morning meal," yielding "I ate breakfast.".
- **examples:**
  - 我吃了早饭(我吃了早飯)。
    - wǒ chī le zǎo fàn
    - I ate breakfast.

  - 去
    - qù
    - go, leave; remove, get rid of
  - 过(過)
    - guò
    - pass, cross; spend time; exceed, too; experiential aspect particle indicating have done before
  - 中
    - zhōng
    - middle, center; in, among; China (abbr.)
  - 国(國)
    - guó
    - country, nation; state apparatus, government
- **etymology:** 去 (qù, "go") marked by 过(過) (guò, "have experienced") turns "go" into "have gone (at least once)," with 中国(中國) (Zhōngguó, "China," lit. "central states") as the goal and 我 (wǒ, "I") as the experiencer. Because 过(過) originally means "pass/cross," placing it after a verb depicts the action as an experience one has "passed through" rather than a current act.
- **examples:**
  - 我去过中国(我去過中國)。
    - wǒ qù guò zhōngguó
    - I have been to China.
  - 我去过中国(我去過中國)，还想再去(還想再去)。
    - wǒ qù guò zhōngguó, hái xiǎng zài qù

    - zhe
    - aspect particle indicating ongoing action or state
  - 工
    - gōng
    - work, labor; craft, skill
  - 作
    - zuò
    - do, make; write, compose; act, behave; be, serve as
- **etymology:** 我 (wǒ, "I") + 们(們) (men, "plural suffix") yields a plural subject, while the V着V serial-verb pattern uses 坐 (zuò, "sit") + 着(著) (zhe, "durative/state")—a classical continuative marker—to background a maintained posture and foreground 工作 (gōngzuò, "to work"), naturally expressing work while sitting without a conjunction. 工作 is transparently 工 (gōng, "labor") + 作 (zuò, "do"), literally ‘do labor,’ which has lexicalized as the standard verb for ‘work’ in modern Mandarin.
- **examples:**
  - 我们坐着工作(我們坐著工作)，效率反而更高(效率反而更高)。
    - wǒ men zuò zhe gōng zuò, xiào lǜ fǎn ér gèng gāo
    - We work while sitting, and our efficiency is actually higher.
