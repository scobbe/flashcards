%%%


## 着(著)
---
- **pinyin:** zhe
- **definition:** aspect particle showing ongoing state
- **etymology:** Traditional form is phono-semantic: the grass radical hints ‘to sprout/appear’ and 者 supplies sound and the sense ‘that which is,’ yielding ‘to be manifest/attached,’ which grammaticalized into marking an ongoing state. The simplified eye-based form (目 with 羊 as phonetic) is a later shape substitution, while the aspect meaning still reflects continued presence.
- **examples:**
  - 门开着(門開著)。
    - mén kāi zhe
    - The door is open.
  - 墙上挂着一幅画(牆上掛著一幅畫)。

## 过(過)
---
- **pinyin:** guò
- **definition:** aspect particle showing past experience
- **etymology:** Phono-semantic: the walk/road radical (辵/辶) signals motion or passing, while 咼 supplies the sound and contributes the ‘fault’ sense in some usages. The core idea ‘to pass/go by’ extends to the experiential aspect—having ‘passed through’ an event.
- **examples:**

    - nǐ kàn guò zhè bù diànyǐng ma

%%%


## 着(著)
---
- **pinyin:** V1 zhe V2
- **definition:** do V2 while doing V1
- **etymology:** Phono-semantic compound: traditional form uses 艹 ‘grass’ (emerge, be apparent) with 者 as phonetic, meaning ‘to be manifest; to stick/attach,’ while the simplified form swaps in 目 ‘eye’ to stress visibility. From the sense of something remaining attached/visible comes the durative particle meaning maintaining a state (V1) while performing another action (V2).
- **examples:**
  - 他听着音乐学习(他聽著音樂學習)。
    - tā tīng zhe yīnyuè xuéxí
    - He studies while listening to music.
