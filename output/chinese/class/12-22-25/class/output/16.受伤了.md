- **etymology:** 受 (shòu, "receive; suffer") casts harm as something passively undergone while 傷 (shāng, "wound; to injure") names the blow, yielding 受傷 as “to receive injury,” a long-standing pattern where 受 marks the patient of an external force. 了 (le, "change-of-state/completion particle") flags that this has now occurred, shifting the situation to “got injured.”.
