## 着(著)
---
- **pinyin:** zhe
- **definition:** aspect particle showing ongoing state
- **etymology:** Traditional form is phono-semantic: the grass radical hints ‘to sprout/appear’ and 者 supplies sound and the sense ‘that which is,’ yielding ‘to be manifest/attached,’ which grammaticalized into marking an ongoing state. The simplified eye-based form (目 with 羊 as phonetic) is a later shape substitution, while the aspect meaning still reflects continued presence.
- **examples:**
  - 门开着(門開著)。
    - mén kāi zhe
    - The door is open.
  - 墙上挂着一幅画(牆上掛著一幅畫)。
    - qiáng shàng guà zhe yī fú huà
    - A painting is hanging on the wall.
