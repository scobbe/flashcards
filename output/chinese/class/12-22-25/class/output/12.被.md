## 被
---
- **pinyin:** bèi
- **definition:** passive marker
- **etymology:** Left side is 'clothing' (衣) and right side is 'hide/skin' (皮) as phonetic, together originally meaning a covering or quilt laid over the body. The modern passive sense extends this idea of being 'covered by' into being subjected to an external action.
- **examples:**
  - 他被老师批评了(他被老師批評了)。
    - tā bèi lǎoshī pīpíng le
    - He was criticized by the teacher.
