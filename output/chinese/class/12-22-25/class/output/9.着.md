## 着(著)
---
- **pinyin:** V1 zhe V2
- **definition:** do V2 while doing V1
- **etymology:** Phono-semantic compound: traditional form uses 艹 ‘grass’ (emerge, be apparent) with 者 as phonetic, meaning ‘to be manifest; to stick/attach,’ while the simplified form swaps in 目 ‘eye’ to stress visibility. From the sense of something remaining attached/visible comes the durative particle meaning maintaining a state (V1) while performing another action (V2).
- **examples:**
  - 他听着音乐学习(他聽著音樂學習)。
    - tā tīng zhe yīnyuè xuéxí
    - He studies while listening to music.
