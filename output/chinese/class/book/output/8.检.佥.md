- **traditional:** 僉
- **simplified:** 佥
- **pronunciation:** qiān
- **definition:** 
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 佥(僉)同 (qiān tóng, "unanimously agree")
  - 佥(僉)议(議) (qiān yì, "unanimous decision")
  - 佥(僉)押 (qiān yā, "joint countersign")
  - 佥(僉)谋(謀) (qiān móu, "plot together")
- **etymology (僉):**
  - **type:** ideogrammic compound
  - **description:** ideogrammic: 亼 (jí, "gather") + 兄 (xiōng, "elder brother") + 兄 (xiōng, "elder brother") → ideogrammic: 亼 (jí, "gather") + 吅 (xuān, "voices together") + 从(從) (cóng, "together").
  - **interpretation:** The earliest form combines 亼 "gather" with two instances of 兄 "person/elder brother" to show multiple people assembled and speaking in one voice, hence unanimity. In small seal, it was regularized to 亼 plus a "voices together" element 吅 with 从 "together/acting in concert," reinforcing the sense of acting or agreeing as one.
  - **component characters:**

  - **reference:** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%83%89
  - **simplification rule (佥):** Stroke reduction by collapsing the duplicated 兄 elements of 僉 into a more compact structure, yielding 佥, which was then reused as a simplifying component in related characters.
