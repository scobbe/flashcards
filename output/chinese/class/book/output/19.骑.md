## to ride
---
- **traditional:** 騎
- **simplified:** 骑
- **pronunciation:** qí
- **definition:** to ride
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 骑(騎)马(馬) (qímǎ, "ride a horse")
  - 骑(騎)车(車) (qíchē, "ride a bicycle")
  - 骑(騎)手 (qíshǒu, "horse rider")
  - 骑(騎)士 (qíshì, "medieval knight")
- **etymology (騎):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** phono-semantic: semantic: 马(馬) (mǎ, "horse") + phonetic: 奇 (qí, "strange") → ride horseback.
  - **interpretation:** Formed with 马(馬) as the semantic determinative indicating horses, and 奇 as the phonetic approximating the sound qí. The horse determinative anchors the meaning to riding, originally on horseback, which extends in modern usage to bicycles and other mounts. Alternative proposals about the word’s external origin do not affect the character’s phono-semantic structure.
  - **component characters:**
    - 马(馬) (mǎ, "horse")
    - 奇 (qí, "strange")
  - **reference:** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%A8%8E
  - **simplification rule (骑):** The traditional left-side horse radical 馬 was simplified to 马 while retaining the phonetic component 奇, reducing stroke count and regularizing the form.
