## medical; doctor
### sub-word
#### medical expenses
---
- **traditional:** 醫
- **simplified:** 医
- **pronunciation:** yī
- **definition:** medical; doctor
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 医(醫)生 (yīshēng, "medical doctor")
  - 医(醫)院 (yīyuàn, "general hospital")
  - 医(醫)学(學) (yīxué, "medical science")
  - 医(醫)疗(療) (yīliáo, "medical treatment")
- **etymology (醫):**
  - **type:** ideogrammic compound → phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** ideogrammic: 匸 (xì, "store") + 矢 (shǐ, "arrow") → phono-semantic: phonetic 殹 (yì, "groan") + semantic 酉 (yǒu, "liquor").
  - **interpretation:** The earliest graph 医 combined 匸 (xì, "store") and 矢 (shǐ, "arrow") to depict an arrow case. Later, 醫 was created as a phono-semantic compound with 殹 (yì, "groan") as the phonetic and 酉 (yǒu, "liquor") as the semantic, reflecting medicinal alcohol and treating illness. The simplified form reuses the old shape 医 for this medical word today.
  - **component characters:**
    - 匸 (xì, "store")
    - 矢 (shǐ, "arrow")
    - 殹 (yì, "groan")
    - 酉 (yǒu, "liquor")
  - **reference:** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%86%AB
  - **simplification rule (医):** The simplified form replaced the complex phono-semantic 醫 with the ancient graph 医, removing the 酉 and 殹 components to reduce strokes and regularize the structure.
