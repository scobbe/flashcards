  - 不爱(愛) (bú ài, "do not love")
- **etymology (不):**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** pictogram: depiction of calyx of a flower → semantic: negation meaning adopted by back-borrowing from 否 (fǒu, "no"), a phono-semantic with phonetic 不 (bù, "calyx") and semantic 口 (kǒu, "mouth").
  - **interpretation:** It depicts the calyx of a flower. When 不 served as the phonetic in the phono-semantic 否 (fǒu, "no") with 口 (kǒu, "mouth") as the semantic, that negative sense spread back and became the main meaning of 不 in use today. An alternative Shuowen-style interpretation regards it as a bird flying upward toward the sky.
