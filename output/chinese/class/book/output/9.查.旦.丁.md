  - **interpretation:** It depicts the flat-topped head of a nail, a concrete object; the specific noun for ‘nail’ later came to be written with the derivative 钉(釘). Alternative proposals see it as a human head or a square city wall, reflecting different readings of the simple graph. Modern abstract uses such as the heavenly stem and a surname are conventional extensions detached from the original picture.
