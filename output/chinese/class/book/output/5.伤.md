- **etymology (傷):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** phono-semantic: semantic: 人 (rén, "person") + phonetic: 昜 (yáng, "rising sun") → simplified: 昜 (yáng, "rising sun") → 力 (lì, "strength").
  - **interpretation:** Originally it is a phono-semantic compound with 人 (rén, "person") as the semantic determinative and 昜 (yáng, "rising sun") as the phonetic, indicating the sound. The 人 element ties the meaning to harm to a person, matching modern senses like injury and wounding. In the simplified form, 昜 was replaced by 力 for graphic economy while meaning and pronunciation remained; some scholars also propose a causative link to 疡(瘍) (yáng, "ulcer").

    - 昜 (yáng, "rising sun")
    - 力 (lì, "strength")
  - **reference:** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%82%B7
  - **simplification rule (伤):** Component replacement and stroke reduction: the phonetic 昜 was replaced by 力 to simplify the structure while retaining the original semantics.
