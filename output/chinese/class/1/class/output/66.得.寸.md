- **etymology (寸):**
  - **type:** phonetic loan
  - **description:** phonetic loan: 尊 (zūn, "venerate") abbreviated and borrowed to write the morpheme for the unit of length "inch".
  - **interpretation:** This is a phonetic borrowing: an abbreviated form of 尊 (zūn, "venerate") was used to write a similarly sounding word meaning a unit of length, yielding the modern sense "inch". An alternative view treats the graph as an ideogram marking the wrist pulse point on 手 (shǒu, "hand"), also regarded as the original form of 肘 (zhǒu, "elbow").
