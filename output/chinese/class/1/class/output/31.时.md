## time; hour
### sub-word
#### hour
---
- **traditional:** 時
- **simplified:** 时
- **pronunciation:** shí
- **definition:** time; hour
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 时(時)事 (shí shì, "current affairs")
  - 时(時)局 (shí jú, "current political situation")
  - 时(時)不我待 (shí bù wǒ dài, "time waits for no one")
  - 时(時)有发(發)生 (shí yǒu fā shēng, "occur from time to time")
- **etymology (時):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** phono-semantic: 日 (rì, "sun; day") + 之 (zhī, "to go") → phono-semantic: 日 (rì, "sun; day") + 寺 (sì, "temple") → simplified (cursive-derived): 日 (rì, "sun; day") + 寸 (cùn, "inch").
  - **interpretation:** The semantic determinative 日 points to the sun/day, anchoring the meaning to time. The early phonetic was 之, later replaced by 寺 in 時; the modern simplified 时 comes from a cursive-derived reduction replacing 寺 with 寸. The semantic component aligns with modern senses like time and hour, while the phonetics supplied the pronunciation.
  - **component characters:**
    - 日
    - 之
    - 寺
    - 寸
  - **reference:** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%99%82
  - **simplification rule (时):** The right-side phonetic 寺 was replaced by the simpler component 寸, a cursive-derived stroke reduction and component substitution to regularize and simplify the form.
