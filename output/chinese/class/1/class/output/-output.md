- **etymology (數):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** phono-semantic: phonetic 娄(婁) (lóu, "surname Lou") + semantic 攴 (pū, "tap").
  - **interpretation:** The character combines 娄(婁) as a phonetic element with 攴 as a semantic determinative indicating an action, yielding the verb sense "to count." The noun sense "number" developed via an exopassive derivation with an Old Chinese -s suffix, meaning "what is counted." The semantic component fits modern uses involving counting and numbers.
  - **component characters:**
    - 娄(婁) (lóu, "surname Lou")
    - 攴 (pū, "tap")
  - **reference:** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%95%B8
  - **simplification rule (数):** Simplified by replacing the phonetic 婁 with its simplified form 娄 and by using the short right-hand component 攵 for 攴, reducing strokes while preserving the original phono-semantic structure.

  - **interpretation:** Originally, semantic 爪 and 女 marked the human/hand domain while 角 served as the phonetic, yielding a reading similar to modern lóu; the exact original meaning is noted as uncertain in the source. It was later reinterpreted ideogrammically as 母 over 中 and 女, a folk-analytic layout that does not directly motivate the modern proper-noun and surname uses but reflects a later semantic reading.

  - **interpretation:** It originally depicts a hand picking up a cowry shell, sometimes with the “step” sign to situate the action on a road, yielding the sense “to obtain; to get.” Later graphic regularizations produced the current form, while the core meaning extended to ‘result/produce’ and grammaticalized into modal ‘can/may’ (often in negatives as 不得) and the complement particle. Pulleyblank’s proposed relation to Tibetan thub (“to be able to; to withstand”) is an external etymology note, but the semantic path within Chinese remains ‘to obtain’ → ability/permission and structural marking.

- **etymology (寸):**
  - **type:** phonetic loan
  - **description:** phonetic loan: 尊 (zūn, "venerate") abbreviated and borrowed to write the morpheme for the unit of length "inch".
  - **interpretation:** This is a phonetic borrowing: an abbreviated form of 尊 (zūn, "venerate") was used to write a similarly sounding word meaning a unit of length, yielding the modern sense "inch". An alternative view treats the graph as an ideogram marking the wrist pulse point on 手 (shǒu, "hand"), also regarded as the original form of 肘 (zhǒu, "elbow").
