- **traditional:** 棗
- **simplified:** 枣
- **pronunciation:** zǎo
- **definition:** 
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 大枣(棗) (dà zǎo, "jujube")
  - 枣(棗)子 (zǎo zi, "jujube fruit")
  - 枣(棗)仁 (zǎo rén, "jujube kernel")
- **etymology (棗):**
  - **type:** ideogrammic compound
  - **description:** ideogrammic: 朿 (cì, "thorn") + 朿 (cì, "thorn").
  - **interpretation:** Duplication of 朿 "thorn" evokes a very thorny plant, identified with the jujube tree. The character thus came to denote the tree and its fruit, which remains the modern meaning.
  - **component characters:**
    - 朿
  - **reference:** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%A3%97
  - **simplification rule (枣):** The traditional duplication in 棗 was simplified by replacing the lower 朿 component with the dot component ⺀, reducing strokes to form 枣.
