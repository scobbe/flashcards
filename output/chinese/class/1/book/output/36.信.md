- **traditional:** 信
- **simplified:** 信
- **pronunciation:** xìn
- **definition:** letter or mail; to believe or trust
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 信息 (xìnxī, "news and information")
  - 信任 (xìnrèn, "to trust")
  - 信物 (xìnwù, "token or keepsake")
- **etymology (信):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** phono-semantic: phonetic: 人 (rén, "person") + semantic: 言 (yán, "speech").
  - **interpretation:** The semantic determinative 言 (yán, "speech") situates the character in the domain of words, messages, and communication, matching senses like letter and message. 人 functions as the phonetic, giving the historical sound that developed into xìn; combined, it also evokes a person's words as reliable, underpinning the senses of trust and belief. Some sources such as Shuowen note an alternative ideogrammic analysis.
