- **etymology (醫):**
  - **type:** ideogrammic compound → phono-semantic compound
  - **description:**
    - ideogrammic: 匸 (xì, "storage") + 矢 (shǐ, "arrow") →
    - phono-semantic: phonetic: 殹 (yì, "interjection") + semantic: 酉 (yǒu, "liquor")
  - **interpretation:** Originally, 医 depicts an enclosure with an arrow, referring to a container for storing bows/arrows. The medical sense developed in 醫, where 酉 serves as the semantic determinative for medicinal liquids and 殹 provides the sound. In modern Simplified Chinese, 醫 was simplified back to 医 while retaining the medical meanings.
