    - semantic: 车(車) (chē, "cart") + phonetic: 耎 (ruǎn, "soft") →
    - popular variant replaced 耎 with 欠 (qiàn, "yawn")
  - **interpretation:** The character is a phono-semantic compound with 车(車) (chē, "cart") as the semantic determinative and 耎 (ruǎn, "soft") as the phonetic, pointing to the ruǎn reading. Sources note 车(車) may hint at pliability or weakness associated with hauling a chariot, or relate to 柔 (róu, "soft"). Later, a popular variant used 欠 (qiàn, "yawn"), a figure of a kneeling, open-mouthed person, reinforcing the sense of tiredness and hence softness.
