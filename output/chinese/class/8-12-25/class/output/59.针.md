  - **description:**
    - semantic: 钅(釒) (jīn, "metal") + phonetic: 十 (shí, "ten")
  - **interpretation:** This character is a phono-semantic compound: 钅(釒) (jīn, "metal") serves as the semantic determinative and 十 (shí, "ten") provides the phonetic cue. The metal determinative aligns with the modern meaning of a slender metal needle, while the phonetic element approximated the historical pronunciation leading to zhēn.

  - **reference:** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%87%9D
  - **simplification rule (针):** The traditional metal component 釒 was simplified to the abbreviated radical form 钅 on the left side, reducing strokes while keeping the phonetic 十 unchanged.
