  - **description:**
    - semantic: 刚(剛) (gāng, "just") + 刚(剛) (gāng, "just")
  - **interpretation:** Formed by reduplicating 刚 to emphasize immediacy. The base 刚 means “just; barely”, and repetition reinforces recency or minimal degree, yielding the modern senses “just now” and “barely”.

  - **simplification rule (刚刚):** 剛 was simplified to 刚 by replacing 岡 with 冈 and reducing strokes; in the reduplicated word, both instances follow this component replacement.
