- **etymology (剛):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:**
    - semantic: 刀 (dāo, "knife") + phonetic: 冈(岡) (gāng, "ridge") →
    - 刚(剛) (gāng, "hard; strong")
  - **interpretation:** 刀 (dāo, "knife") serves as the semantic determinative, pointing to cutting/hardness. 冈(岡) (gāng, "ridge") supplies the sound value gāng. The simplified form keeps the same morphology, and the semantic ‘knife’ aligns with the sense ‘hard, firm’, which in modern usage also extended to the adverbial meaning ‘just’ in time expressions.
  - **component characters:**
    - 刀
      - dāo
      - knife
    - 冈(岡)
      - gāng
      - ridge
  - **reference:** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%89%9B
  - **simplification rule (刚):** The phonetic component 岡 was replaced by its simplified form 冈 to reduce strokes, while retaining the knife radical, yielding the simplified structure 冈 + 刂 in 刚.
