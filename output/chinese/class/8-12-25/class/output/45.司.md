- **etymology (司):**
  - **type:** ideogrammic compound
  - **description:** ideogrammic: 口 (kǒu, "mouth") + 刁 (diāo, "scepter") → 司.
  - **interpretation:** Combines 口, depicting a mouth giving orders, with 刁 interpreted as a scepter or an authoritative implement, to convey exercising command and oversight. This aligns with modern senses like “to manage” and “official”. Some sources alternatively see 刁 as a hand, and others relate 司 historically to 后 (as a flipped or once-identical form).
