    - phono-semantic: semantic: 木 (mù, "wood") + phonetic: 羊 (yáng, "sheep")
  - **interpretation:** A phono-semantic compound: 木 (mù, "wood") supplies the semantic field of objects and forms, while 羊 (yáng, "sheep") provides the sound. In the simplified form, the phonetic was regularized to 羊 (yáng), keeping a similar reading; the meaning 'appearance; kind' aligns with the idea of a thing’s form or pattern indicated by 木.
