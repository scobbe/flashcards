  - **description:**
    - pictogram: 首 (shǒu, "head") + 卩 (jié, "kneeling person") →
    - semantic: 叶(葉) (yè, "leaf")
  - **interpretation:** It depicts the head of a kneeling person, originally meaning “head”. Later it was borrowed as an alternative form of 叶(葉) “leaf”, extending to the notion of a sheet of paper and hence a “page”, which is the primary modern sense.
