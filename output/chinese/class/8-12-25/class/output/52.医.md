- **etymology (醫):**
  - **type:** ideogrammic compound
  - **description:**
    - ideogrammic: 匸 (xì, "that which hides; that which stores") + 矢 (shǐ, "arrow")
  - **interpretation:** The graph combines 匸 (xì, "store") and 矢 (shǐ, "arrow") to indicate a container for arrows, i.e., a quiver—its original sense. In modern use, 医 is the simplified form of 醫 (yī, "medical"), whose semantic determinative 酉 (yǒu, "liquor") ties to medicines and decoctions; simplification removed that component, leaving 医 to carry the medical sense.
  - **component characters:**

  - **reference:** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%86%AB
  - **simplification rule (医):** Adopted as the simplified form of 醫 by eliminating the 酉 and 殳 components, reducing strokes and regularizing the shape to 医.
