- **etymology (學):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:**
    - phonetic: 爻 (yáo, "trigram lines") + phonetic: 六 (liù, "six") →
    - semantic: 子 (zǐ, "child") added below
  - **interpretation:** The top cluster combines 爻 and 六 as the phonetic, while 子 acts as the semantic determinative indicating a child, aligning with the idea of a child learning and thus the sense ‘study/learning’. Some sources alternatively analyze it as an abbreviation of 敎 (jiào, "to teach") under a roof 宀 (mián, "roof"), but early forms lacking the child favor the phono-semantic analysis.

  - **simplification rule (学):** Simplified from 學 by replacing the complex top component with a reduced form and regularizing it into a roof-like cover, lowering stroke count and merging strokes.
