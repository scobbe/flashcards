    - phonetic: 敄 (mò, "phonetic element") + semantic: 力 (lì, "strength")
  - **interpretation:** The traditional form 务(務) (wù, "affairs") is a phono-semantic compound with 敄 (mò) as the phonetic indicating the wù reading, while 力 (lì, "strength") supplies the semantic field of exertion and work. The simplified form 务 retains this semantic cue, which aligns with modern senses such as duties and engaging in tasks.
