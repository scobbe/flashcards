- **etymology (婁):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound → ideogrammic compound
  - **description:**
    - phono-semantic: 爪 (zhǎo, "hands") + 角 (jiǎo, "horn") + 女 (nǚ, "woman") →
    - ideogrammic: 母 (mǔ, "mother") + 中 (zhōng, "middle") + 女 (nǚ, "woman")
  - **interpretation:** Originally, semantic 爪 and 女 marked the human/hand domain while 角 served as the phonetic, yielding a reading similar to modern lóu; the exact original meaning is noted as uncertain in the source. It was later reinterpreted ideogrammically as 母 over 中 and 女, a folk-analytic layout that does not directly motivate the modern proper-noun and surname uses but reflects a later semantic reading.
