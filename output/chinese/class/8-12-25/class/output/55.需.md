    - ideogrammic: 天 (tiān, "person") + 雨 (yǔ, "rain") →
    - 雨 (yǔ, "rain") + 而 (ér, "and")
  - **interpretation:** It depicts a person getting wet in the rain, hence an original sense of becoming wet; it later served as the graph for ‘wait’ in early usage. The form was standardized with the rain radical over 而, and the sense extended to ‘need/require’ in modern compounds where necessities or awaited items are implied.
