- **etymology (早):**
  - **type:** pictogram → phono-semantic compound → ideogrammic compound
  - **description:**
    - pictogram: depiction of an acorn →.
    - phono-semantic: semantic 日 (rì, "sun") + phonetic 枣(棗) (zǎo, "jujube") →
    - ideogrammic: 日 (rì, "sun") + 甲 (jiǎ, "first")
  - **interpretation:** It originally depicts an acorn and was later borrowed for the sound to write the “morning/early” word. The character was then reshaped as a phono-semantic compound with 日 providing the day/time domain and 枣(棗) giving the sound. Xu Shen later interpreted the small seal form as an ideogram of 日 with 甲 to mean “when the sun first rises,” though this view is not based on the earliest inscriptions.
