    - 校
  - **interpretation:** 木 (mù, "tree") is the semantic determinative, originally pointing to wooden implements or structures, while 交 (jiāo, "cross") provides the sound. Some sources analyze the verb sense jiào "to examine/compare" as a derivation from 交 with a causative suffix, and the school-related xiào usage later became a bound noun in compounds while retaining the same phonetic.
