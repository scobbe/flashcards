- **etymology (漢):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:**
    - semantic: 水 (shuǐ, "water") + phonetic: 暵 (hàn, "scorch") →
    - river name
  - **interpretation:** 水 (shuǐ, "water") marks the semantic domain of rivers, while 暵 (hàn) provides the sound, yielding a name for the Han River. This toponym later extended to the dynasty and the ethnonym, giving the modern senses "Han/Chinese." Some sources cite 熯 (hàn) or 難(难) (nán, "difficult") as alternative phonetics; the modern simplified form 汉 was created in 1956 by reducing the right component to 又 while retaining the water radical.

  - **reference:** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%BC%A2
  - **simplification rule (汉):** The traditional form 漢 was simplified by replacing its complex right-side phonetic component (𦰩, written with 廿 over 口 and 夫) with 又, keeping the water radical and greatly reducing stroke count.
