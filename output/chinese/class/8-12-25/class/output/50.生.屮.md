    - pictogram: depiction of sprout emerging from ground →.
    - standardized form using 凵 (kǎn, "open box") with central 丨 (gǔn, "line") or 丿 (piě, "slash")
  - **interpretation:** It depicts a sprout pushing up, with 凵 (kǎn, "open box") as the ground and 丨/丿 (gǔn/piě, "line/slash") as the shoot, yielding the original sense ‘new plant growth’. This concrete image explains its role as the grass radical in plant-related characters. Some traditions also linked the ⿻凵丿 form with 左 (zuǒ, "left"), giving a secondary ‘left hand’ reading.
