  - **description:**
    - phonetic: 辛 (xīn, "spicy") + semantic: 见(見) (jiàn, "see") →
    - 亲(親) (qīn, "kin")
  - **interpretation:** Formed with 见(見) (jiàn, "see") as the semantic indicator of personal contact and 辛 (xīn, "spicy") as the phonetic. The left element was later regularized as 亲(親) (qīn, "kin"), and the sense extended from doing or seeing something in person to ‘close/intimate’ and ‘relatives’.

  - **reference:** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%A6%AA
  - **simplification rule (亲):** The traditional form 親 was simplified by dropping the right-side semantic 见(見) and adopting the left phonetic element 亲 as the whole character, reducing strokes and regularizing the structure.
