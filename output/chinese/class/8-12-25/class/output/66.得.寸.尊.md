    - ideogrammic: 酋 (qiú, "wine") + 寸 (cùn, "hand") →
    - 尊
  - **interpretation:** Combines 酋 (qiú, "wine") and 寸 (cùn, "hand") to depict offering wine with the hand as a sign of respect. This ritual offering yields the meanings ‘to honor’ and ‘to venerate’ in modern usage. An alternative analysis reads it as 酋 (qiú, "wine") with 廾 (gǒng, "two hands"), likewise indicating a respectful two‑handed offering.
