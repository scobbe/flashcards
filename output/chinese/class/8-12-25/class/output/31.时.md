- **etymology (時):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:**
    - phono-semantic: 日 (rì, "sun; day") + 之 (zhī, "to go") →
    - phono-semantic: 日 (rì, "sun; day") + 寺 (sì, "temple") →
    - simplified (cursive-derived): 日 (rì, "sun; day") + 寸 (cùn, "inch")
  - **interpretation:** The semantic determinative 日 points to the sun/day, anchoring the meaning to time. The early phonetic was 之, later replaced by 寺 in 時; the modern simplified 时 comes from a cursive-derived reduction replacing 寺 with 寸. The semantic component aligns with modern senses like time and hour, while the phonetics supplied the pronunciation.

  - **simplification rule (时):** The right-side phonetic 寺 was replaced by the simpler component 寸, a cursive-derived stroke reduction and component substitution to regularize and simplify the form.
