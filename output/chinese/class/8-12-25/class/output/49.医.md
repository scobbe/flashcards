  - **interpretation:** Originally, 医 depicted a container and an arrow, referring to a quiver for storing weapons. The medical word was later formed as 醫 with 酉 as the semantic indicator of liquor/medications and 殹 as the phonetic, aligning with the medical domain. Modern 医 is the simplified form of 醫, preserving the sound yī and its medical meanings.
