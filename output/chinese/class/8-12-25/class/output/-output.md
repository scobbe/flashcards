  - **description:**
    - phono-semantic: phonetic 娄(婁) (lóu, "surname Lou") + semantic 攴 (pū, "tap")
  - **interpretation:** The character combines 娄(婁) as a phonetic element with 攴 as a semantic determinative indicating an action, yielding the verb sense "to count." The noun sense "number" developed via an exopassive derivation with an Old Chinese -s suffix, meaning "what is counted." The semantic component fits modern uses involving counting and numbers.

    - ideogrammic: 母 (mǔ, "mother") + 中 (zhōng, "middle") + 女 (nǚ, "woman")
  - **interpretation:** Originally, semantic 爪 and 女 marked the human/hand domain while 角 served as the phonetic, yielding a reading similar to modern lóu; the exact original meaning is noted as uncertain in the source. It was later reinterpreted ideogrammically as 母 over 中 and 女, a folk-analytic layout that does not directly motivate the modern proper-noun and surname uses but reflects a later semantic reading.

From this core sense, the verb sense “to hit the center; to be affected” developed (zhòng). Alternative analyses note a vertical 丨 (gǔn, "vertical stroke") passing through 口 (kǒu, "mouth"), or an arrow striking a target’s center.

    - semantic: 日 (rì, "sun") + phonetic: 勺 (sháo, "ladle") →
    - semantic: 白 (bái, "white") + phonetic: 勺 (sháo, "ladle")
  - **interpretation:** The character combines a semantic determinative of light/color (originally 日, later 白) with the phonetic 勺. This explains early senses like “bright” and the target mark. The possessive particle use is a later borrowing to write the high‑frequency grammatical marker de, supplanting 底; proposals link it to lenited 之, 者, or 底.

    - semantic: 彳 (chì, "step") added to indicate action on the road →
    - phonetic: 又 (yòu, "hand") replaced by 寸 (cùn, "inch") in Qin script →
    - graphic simplification: 贝(貝) (bèi, "cowry") simplified to 目 (mù, "eye") and later regularized as 旦 (dàn, "dawn")
  - **interpretation:** It originally depicts a hand picking up a cowry shell, sometimes with the “step” sign to situate the action on a road, yielding the sense “to obtain; to get.” Later graphic regularizations produced the current form, while the core meaning extended to ‘result/produce’ and grammaticalized into modal ‘can/may’ (often in negatives as 不得) and the complement particle. Pulleyblank’s proposed relation to Tibetan thub (“to be able to; to withstand”) is an external etymology note, but the semantic path within Chinese remains ‘to obtain’ → ability/permission and structural marking.

  - **interpretation:** This is a phonetic borrowing: an abbreviated form of 尊 (zūn, "venerate") was used to write a similarly sounding word meaning a unit of length, yielding the modern sense "inch". An alternative view treats the graph as an ideogram marking the wrist pulse point on 手 (shǒu, "hand"), also regarded as the original form of 肘 (zhǒu, "elbow").

  - **interpretation:** Combines 酋 (qiú, "wine") and 寸 (cùn, "hand") to depict offering wine with the hand as a sign of respect. This ritual offering yields the meanings ‘to honor’ and ‘to venerate’ in modern usage.

  - **interpretation:** 堡 (bǎo, "fortress") supplies the meaning, matching the -burg element in German place names, while 汉(漢) (hàn, "Han Chinese") contributes the syllable han to approximate “Ham-”. Thus 汉堡 was coined to render Hamburg; the food sense developed as a short form of 汉(漢)堡包 (hànbǎobāo, "Hamburg bun"). Sources differ on whether English or German served as the immediate donor language, but the mapping is the same.

This toponym later extended to the dynasty and the ethnonym, giving the modern senses "Han/Chinese." Some sources cite 熯 (hàn) or 難(难) (nán, "difficult") as alternative phonetics; the modern simplified form 汉 was created in 1956 by reducing the right component to 又 while retaining the water radical.

- **etymology (第):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:**
    - semantic: 竹 (zhú, "bamboo") + phonetic: 弟 (dì, "younger brother") →
    - 第
  - **interpretation:** The character combines the semantic 竹, referring to bamboo slips used for writing, tallying, and classification, with the phonetic 弟 to indicate sound. The bamboo determinative aligns with ordering and ranking on slips, which underlies the modern sense of ordinal sequencing. Some sources note an alternative early writing as 弟, but the established form uses 竹 as the semantic determinative.

  - **interpretation:** It depicts a person exhaling, reflecting breath or a sigh. The graph later came to write the word meaning order/next and the classifier for occurrences, with the original pictographic sense no longer active. An alternative analysis in Shuowen treats it as phono-semantic with 二 (èr, "two") plus 欠 (qiàn, "yawn"), but early forms do not support this.
