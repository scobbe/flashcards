- **etymology (服):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:**
    - phono-semantic: 凡 (fán, "tray") + phonetic: 𠬝 (fú, "to subdue") →
    - semantic corrupted to 舟 (zhōu, "boat") →
    - later regularized as 月 (yuè, "moon")
  - **interpretation:** The character combined semantic 凡, evoking presentation/serving (a tray), with phonetic 𠬝, which also carried the sense of subduing, yielding meanings like serve and submit. Over time the left semantic was graphically altered from 凡 to 舟 and then 月 without changing the core semantics; later reanalysis under 月 helped connect usages involving the body, such as wearing clothes and ingesting medicine.
