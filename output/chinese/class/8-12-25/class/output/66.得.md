---
- **traditional:** 得
- **simplified:** 得
- **pronunciation:** de; děi
- **definition:** structural particle; must or have to

  - 我得工作

    - I have to work
  - 不得
    - bù dé

- **etymology (得):**
  - **type:** ideogrammic compound
  - **description:**
    - ideogrammic: 贝(貝) (bèi, "cowry") + 又 (yòu, "hand") →
    - semantic: 彳 (chì, "step") added to indicate action on the road →
    - phonetic: 又 (yòu, "hand") replaced by 寸 (cùn, "inch") in Qin script →
    - graphic simplification: 贝(貝) (bèi, "cowry") simplified to 目 (mù, "eye") and later regularized as 旦 (dàn, "dawn")
  - **interpretation:** It originally depicts a hand picking up a cowry shell, sometimes with the “step” sign to situate the action on a road, yielding the sense “to obtain; to get.” Later graphic regularizations produced the current form, while the core meaning extended to ‘result/produce’ and grammaticalized into modal ‘can/may’ (often in negatives as 不得) and the complement particle. Pulleyblank’s proposed relation to Tibetan thub (“to be able to; to withstand”) is an external etymology note, but the semantic path within Chinese remains ‘to obtain’ → ability/permission and structural marking.
