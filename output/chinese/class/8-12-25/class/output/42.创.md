    - phonetic: 仓(倉) (cāng, "granary") + semantic: 刀 (dāo, "knife") →
    - 创(創) (chuàng/chuāng, "create; wound")
  - **interpretation:** The character combines 仓(倉) (cāng, "granary") as the phonetic with 刀 (dāo, "knife") as the semantic indicator of cutting, yielding the sense of a knife wound. The original meaning was "wound; cut," and it later extended to chuàng "to initiate/create," metaphorically from cutting or opening a new undertaking.
