- **contemporary usage:**
  - None, not in contemporary use.
- **etymology (㒸):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** phono-semantic: semantic: 丷 (bā, "eight") + phonetic: 豕 (shǐ, "pig").
  - **interpretation:** The top element 丷 serves as the semantic determinative, while 豕 provides the sound suì. The source notes that how “divide” from 丷 relates to the original sense “comply, follow along” is unclear, so the semantic component is likely classificatory rather than literal.
  - **component characters:**
  - 丷
  - 豕
