- **contemporary usage:**
  - None, not in contemporary use.
- **etymology (攴):**
  - **type:** pictogram → phono-semantic compound
  - **description:**
    - pictogram: depiction of 又 (yòu, "hand") holding a tool →
    - phono-semantic: phonetic 卜 (bǔ, "divine") + semantic 又 (yòu, "hand")
  - **interpretation:** It depicts a hand holding an implement used for striking, which gives the sense ‘to hit’ and by extension ‘to tap’. Later scholars also analyze it as phono-semantic, with 又 (yòu, "hand") as the semantic indicator and 卜 (bǔ, "divine") as the phonetic. Some sources classify the earliest form as ideogrammic; the modern meaning ‘tap’ reflects a lighter kind of striking.
