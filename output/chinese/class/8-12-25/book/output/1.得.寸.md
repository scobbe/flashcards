  - **interpretation:** An ideographic mark on a hand indicates the wrist pulse point. The short distance from the wrist to that point was taken as a convenient measure, yielding the unit of length and later figurative senses for something very small. Some analyses also treat the unit sense as a loan use from another graph, but the wrist-pulse explanation is traditional.
