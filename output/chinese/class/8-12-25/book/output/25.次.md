- **etymology (次):**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:**
    - pictogram: depiction of 欠 (qiàn, "yawn") exhaling, with breath marks written as 二 (èr, "two") or 冫 (bīng, "ice")
  - **interpretation:** It depicts a person exhaling; the short strokes (later shaped like 二 or 冫) indicate the expelled breath. The graph was later borrowed and generalized to mean ordering and succession (“next”) and as a classifier for occurrences. An alternative Shuowen analysis treats it as 二 + 欠 phono-semantic, but ancient forms do not support this.
