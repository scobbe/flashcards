  - **description:**
    - phonetic: 雚 (guàn, "reeds") + semantic: 见 (jiàn, "see") →
    - simplified: 又 (yòu, "again") + 见 (jiàn, "see")
  - **interpretation:** The traditional form is a phono-semantic compound with 見 as the semantic determinative "to see" and 雚 as the phonetic indicating the sound guān. In simplification, the complex 雚 was replaced by 又 and 見 by 见 to reduce strokes while preserving the "seeing" determinative. This fits the modern senses related to looking, viewing, and observing.
