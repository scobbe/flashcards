- **etymology (參):**
  - **type:** ideogrammic compound
  - **description:**
    - ideogrammic: 晶 (jīng, "stars") + 光 (guāng, "light") + 彡 (shān, "light rays")
  - **interpretation:** The graph combines 晶 "stars", 光 "light", and 彡 "light rays" to depict the Three Stars asterism and its radiance. The same character was later extended and borrowed to write other morphemes, including cān "to join/participate" and shēn "ginseng", yielding the modern 'participate' sense in compounds. Some sources alternatively analyze the seal-script form as phono-semantic with semantic 晶 and phonetic 㐱, but the bronze forms favor an ideogrammic origin.
