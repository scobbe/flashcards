    - pictogram of 荄 (gāi, "grass root")
  - **interpretation:** Depicts plant roots underground, essentially the 'grass root' 荄 (gāi, "grass root"). By semantic extension it came to denote the twelfth Earthly Branch, plausibly via a sense of a 'sprouting stage' noted in the entry. An alternative view sees it as an animal like 豕 (shǐ, "pig"), and later graphic convergence strengthened its pig association.
