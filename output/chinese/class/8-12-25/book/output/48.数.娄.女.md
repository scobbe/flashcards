    - pictogram: depiction of a woman with prominent breasts kneeling or standing →.
    - modern form rotated to the left, with an enclosed stroke marking the remaining breast.
  - **interpretation:** Depicts a woman with visible breasts, originally shown kneeling or standing. The script later rotated left, and one enclosed stroke preserves the breast detail while the other disappeared. As a direct pictograph of a woman, it naturally came to mean ‘woman/female’ and serves as the semantic base for related terms today.
