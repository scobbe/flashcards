    - pictogram: depiction of a split wooden board from 木 (mù, "wood")
  - **interpretation:** It depicts a split wooden board or slice, which naturally yielded senses like "slice" and "thin piece" and its classifier uses for flat objects. Some sources (Shuowen) interpret it as half of 木 (mù, "wood") to indicate paring or slicing, though this is not supported by oracle or bronze forms.
