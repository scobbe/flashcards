  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** phono-semantic: semantic: 纟(糸) (mì, "silk thread") + phonetic: 罔 (wǎng, "deceive").
  - **interpretation:** The silk radical 纟 marks the semantic field of textiles and woven mesh, fitting the sense of a net. 罔 provides the pronunciation wǎng; later meanings extended from a physical net to abstract networks and the Internet. Some sources also compare Thai words for nets and propose a relation to 罔 “to deceive,” but the graph itself is phono-semantic.
