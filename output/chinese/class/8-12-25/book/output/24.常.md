- **etymology (常):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:**
    - phonetic: 尚 (shàng, "still") + semantic: 巾 (jīn, "cloth")
  - **interpretation:** Formed with 巾 (cloth) as the semantic determinative and 尚 as the phonetic, originally denoting a lower garment. The graph was later borrowed for the homophonous sense ‘long-lasting; frequent’, and the original garment sense was written separately as 裳. The semantic element matches the older clothing-related meaning, while the modern adverbial sense persists via phonetic borrowing.
