    - ideogrammic: 入 (rù, "enter") + 一 (yī, "one")
  - **interpretation:** It combines 入 “enter” over 一 “one” to show things moving in toward a single point/line, hence “gather.” Some sources instead see it as an upside-down 口 (kǒu, "mouth") and regard it as the original form of 今 (jīn, "now"); the character was later associated with 集 (jí, "gather").
