    - semantic: 八 (bā, "eight") + phonetic: 向 (xiàng, "towards")
  - **interpretation:** A semantic element 八 serves as the determinative, while 向 provides the phonetic value. The original sense related to superiority or esteem developed via usage into meanings such as “to value/esteem” and the formal adverbial “still/yet,” with the semantic component functioning chiefly as a classifier while the phonetic guided the reading.
