    - speech
  - **interpretation:** It shows a tongue in the mouth with a mark for movement, conveying the act of speaking. Later stylization added another stroke on top and simplified the tongue shape, but the sense ‘speech’ remained. Some sources alternatively analyze it as phono-semantic with a phonetic element and 口 (kǒu, "mouth") as the semantic.
