- **etymology (婁):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound → ideogrammic compound
  - **description:**
    - phono-semantic: semantic: 爪 (zhǎo, "hands") + phonetic: 角 (jiǎo, "horn") + semantic: 女 (nǚ, "woman") →
    - ideogrammic: 母 (mǔ, "mother") + 中 (zhōng, "middle") + 女 (nǚ, "daughter")
  - **interpretation:** Originally it combined 爪 (zhǎo, "hands") and 女 (nǚ, "woman") around the phonetic 角 (jiǎo, "horn") to write a word pronounced like lóu; the exact original meaning is uncertain. It was later reinterpreted as an ideogrammic 母 (mǔ, "mother") + 中 (zhōng, "middle") + 女 (nǚ, "daughter"), a folk analysis that did not change the reading. The modern proper-name sense for the lunar mansion and colloquial derivatives persist by convention rather than transparent composition.
