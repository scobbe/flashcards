- **etymology (岡):**
  - **type:** pictogram → phono-semantic compound
  - **description:**
    - pictogram of 网(網) (wǎng, "net") →
    - phono-semantic: phonetic: 网(網) (wǎng, "net") + semantic: 山 (shān, "mountain")
  - **interpretation:** Early graphs depict a net. In 岡, 网 serves as the phonetic while 山 supplies the semantic field of terrain, yielding the sense "mountain ridge"; the phonetic accounts for the modern readings gāng/gǎng. In Simplified Chinese, 冑 was not involved; rather, 冈 was adopted as the simplified form of 岡 for this meaning.
