    "description": "Pictogram: a writing brush; later the inverted brush was misread as 又 and moved to the top (form 𰠄) to avoid confusion with 袁 (衣+又).",
    "interpretation": "Early graphs depicted a brush; over time, an upside-down brush shape was reinterpreted as the hand/component 又, prompting scribes to reposition it above. The original image became obscured, while meanings like “to end” and the noun “soldier” developed through later semantic shift and loan usage.",
