    "type": "ideogrammic compound",
    "description": "Ideogrammic compound: 舁 (“both hands of two people”) + 同 (“a generic object”) — two lift something up together; Shuowen takes 同 as “together”.",
    "interpretation": "Two people jointly lifting an object conveys the act of raising or bringing something up, which extends to starting or setting things in motion. By metaphor, it came to express flourishing and promotion as activities that are lifted up together.",
    "simplification": "Simplified from 興 by dropping the bottom 同 and condensing 舁 into a streamlined form 兴, reflecting long-used handwritten/clerical variants and reducing stroke count while keeping the ‘lifting/raising’ idea."
