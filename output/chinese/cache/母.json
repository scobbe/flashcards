    "interpretation": "The character 母(母) (mǔ, \"mother\") is a differentiated form of 女(女) (nǚ, \"woman\") with the addition of two dots to distinguish it. In early script forms, both 母(母) (mǔ, \"mother\") and 女(女) (nǚ, \"woman\") were represented by the same form as 女(女), necessitating the addition of dots to create a visual distinction. The character 毋, originally borrowed from 母, further specialized by changing the dots to a stroke to avoid confusion between the characters.",
