[真]
Originally phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *ʔljin ): phonetic 𠂈 ( OC *l'ɯːnʔ ) + semantic 貝 ( “ cowry ” ) ; 𠂈 (a knife or dagger) was then a phonetic component. Often 丁 ( OC *rteːŋ, *teːŋ ) (a nail) was added as a second phonetic component at the bottom; originally, it appeared as a black dot. He Linyi posits it to be the original character for 珍 ( OC *ʔl'ɯn , “rare; valuable”).
The sound component 𠂈 corrupted into 十 in the modern form, and into 匕 in the orthodox seal script form 眞 . The bottom of the character in both forms derives from the components 貝 and 丁 corrupting into 目 and 丌 .
