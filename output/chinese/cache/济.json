  "etymology": {
    "type": "phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "semantic 水(水) (shuǐ, \"water\") + phonetic 齐(齊) (qí, \"together/even\") = crossing or helping across water -> aid, ferry over",
    "interpretation": "The character 济(濟) conveys the idea of aiding or crossing by associating water, essential for crossing rivers, with 齐(齊) (qí, \"together/even\"), to imply guiding or helping across. This reflects both the literal act of ferrying across water and the metaphorical sense of providing assistance.",
    "simplification": "济 is simplified from 濟 by replacing 齊(齊) (qí, \"together/even\") with its simplified form 齐(齐). This reflects the standardization process where complex traditional components are simplified for ease of writing while retaining phonetic elements."
