    "interpretation": "木 provides the meaning domain of wood/trees, while 尌 contributes the sound and is itself related to planting. In the simplified form, the complex 壴 inside the phonetic component was replaced by 又 to reduce strokes while retaining recognizability.",
    "simplification": "Component 壴 in the phonetic 尌 was replaced by 又 to lower stroke count while keeping 木 on the left for meaning."
