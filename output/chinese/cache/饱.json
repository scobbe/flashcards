  "etymology": {
    "type": "phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "Semantic: 饣(食) (shí, \"food\") + Phonetic: 包(包) (bāo, \"wrap\") -> related to eating and being full",
    "interpretation": "The character 饱(飽) combines the food radical 食(食) (shí, \"food\") with the phonetic 包(包) (bāo, \"wrap\") to signify fullness after eating, as when something is wrapped and contained. This is intuitive because the phonetic component is associated with wrapping or encompassing, which echoes the idea of being filled.",
    "simplification": "饱 was simplified from 飽 by replacing 食(食) (shí, \"food\") with the simpler 饣(饣), retaining both semantic clarity and phonetic hint."
