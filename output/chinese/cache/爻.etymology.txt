Pictogram ( 象形 ): 乂 + 乂 – 2 stacked ‘X’ marks. Some possible explanations exist:
• two couples of yarrow stalks to perform divinations (see also 學 and 覺 )
• two couples of bamboo slips to perform calculations (see also 算 and perhaps both 學 and 覺 )
• two marks to mean "crossing" (compare 交 ) or two marks with a general meaning (see 駁 )
Similar but most likely unrelated to the original form of 五 .
