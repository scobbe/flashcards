    "description": "棵 is a variant form of 樖. 樖: 木(木) (mù, \"wood\") + 柯(柯) (kē) = measure word for trees, derived from structure and sound",
    "interpretation": "The character 棵 utilizes 木(木) (mù, \"wood\") combined with the phonetic 柯(柯) (kē) to indicate its association with trees and plants. Being a variant form, it retains the meaning related to trees due to the presence of 木(木), playing off the phonetic element to denote its function as a measure word.",
