    "interpretation": "Originally, 乂(乂) was used for both its phonetic and semantic meanings but was mainly displaced by 刈(刈). To distinguish the idea of \"righteousness,\" a stroke was added, creating a differentiation that allowed the character to develop its own unique meaning related to justice and propriety.",
