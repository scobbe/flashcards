Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): two hands ( 廾 ) holding an object, perhaps a musical instrument used during a sacrifical ritual (the lower part of the object originally was similar to 夲 ).
Otherwise, the whole character depicts two hands collecting resin ( 桼 ) dripping from a cut tree (drawn like 屮 ). The resin is visible at the bottom of the character.
