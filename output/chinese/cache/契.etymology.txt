Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *kʰeːds, *kʰeːd, *kʰeːd, *kʰɯd ) and ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): phonetic 㓞 ( qià , “ to engrave ” ) + semantic 大 ( “ person ” ) , hence a person making an agreement and/or carving something with a knife.
Possibly a variant of 栔 or vice versa, given that the two characters were used interchangeably in ancient text.
