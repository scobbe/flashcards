In the oracle bone script , a pictogram ( 象形 ): a man carrying something on their shoulder – the original form of 荷 ( OC *ɡaːlʔ , “to carry”).
The object being carried may have been 戈 ( gē ) , in which case the character is also an ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ) and phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *ɡaːl, *ɡaːlʔ ): semantic 人 ( “ person ” ) + phonetic 戈 ( OC *koːl , “ dagger-axe ” ) .
In the bronze inscriptions , some forms of the character were phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *ɡaːl, *ɡaːlʔ ): semantic 人 ( “ person ” ) + phonetic 可 ( OC *kʰaːlʔ ) , from which the modern form derives.

Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *slɯ, *slɯs ): semantic 人 ( “ person, man ” ) + phonetic 司 ( OC *slɯ ) – a person stands beside (attends), looks in.
