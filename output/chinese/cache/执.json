  "etymology": {
    "type": "ideogrammic compound; also phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "Ideogrammic: 㚔 (“criminal/handcuffs”) + 丮 (“hand”); also phono-semantic (OC *tjib): phonetic 㚔 + semantic 丮. In the present form, 㚔 → 幸 and 丮 → 丸.",
    "interpretation": "Combines the notion of a hand restraining a criminal, yielding senses like “to grasp, seize,” and by extension “to carry out/execute.” Later substitutions (幸 and 丸) streamlined the graph while preserving the idea of a hand acting upon something.",
    "simplification": "Mainland simplification reduced 執 by using the hand radical 扌 and simplifying the right-side complex (幸 + 丸) to a compact form with 丸, cutting strokes while keeping the ‘hand + object/action’ cue."
