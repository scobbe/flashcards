[耶]
Corruption of 邪 ( OC *ljaː, *laː ).

[邪]
Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *ljaː, *laː ): phonetic 牙 ( OC *ŋraː ) + semantic 邑 ( “ town; city ” ) .
The semantic component suggests that this character was originally used in a place name, which Shuowen suggests to be 琅邪 . It was later borrowed for other meanings, the most prominent being “wrong; evil” (originally written as 衺 ).
