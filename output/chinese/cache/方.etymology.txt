Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 一 + 刀 ( “ sword ” ) – blade ; tip of a blade. Original form of 芒 ( OC *maːŋ, *maŋ , “ awn (of cereal); tip (of blade)”); later borrowed to mean “side”. Other theories regarding the origin of this character also exist.
It is unrelated to 㫃 (“fluttering flag”), from which characters like 旗 ( OC *ɡɯ , “flag”) and 旅 ( OC *ɡ·raʔ , “troops”) are derived.
