[単]
Simplified from 單 ( 吅 → 𭕄 ). Compare 厳 (from 嚴 ).

[單]
Pictogram ( 象形 ) of a war or hunting weapon, a, Y-shaped wooden stick with two stones attached on top. The component in the middle in some oracle bones was a huge point which represented a rope around the stick; perhaps, this weapon was used as a spear and then retrieved through this rope. Otherwise, the huge point in the middle was another stone attached to the stick. The huge point was then stylized as an horizontal trait, as 口 (the stick resembled 中) and eventually as 田. The horizontal stroke at the bottom of the character was added later.
An alternative theory suggests that it represents a net to catch animals with two weights on top, but the huge point in the middle of the character in some oracle bones may not be a web or net.

[亶]
