[夂]
Pictogram ( 象形 ) of a footprint pointing down. See 夊 ( suī ) , which represents a variant of this character.
Shuowen : Ideogram ( 指事 ) – two legs ( 𠂊 ) followed by something from behind ( ㇏ ) – to approach from behind. However, none of Xu Shen's interpretations are based on oracle bones and Zhou bronzes.
Unrelated to 冬 , in which the top component represents a rope with a knot on top (today 終 ). Also unrelated to 散 despite meaning "to walk".
Pictogram ( 象形 ) – the knot at the end of a rope; ancient form of 終 ("[to] end").

[終]
Originally a pictogram ( 象形 ), 夂 (definition 2) – the knot at the end of a cord. Later reformulated as a phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *tjuŋ ): semantic 糹 + phonetic 冬 ( OC *tuːŋ ) .

[终]
Simplified from 終 ( 糹 → 纟 ).
