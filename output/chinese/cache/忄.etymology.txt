[忄]
Variant of 心 ( “ heart ” ) , when used as left radical (compare 㣺 ).

[心]
Pictogram ( 象形 ) – a heart, now highly stylized.

[必]
Likely a pictogram ( 象形 ) – the handle ( ⿻⿺㇂丶丿 ) found on the right hand side of weapons such as 戊 or 戈 or 戉 written stand-alone. Two decorative strokes were then added to the sides.
Jiajie ( 假借 ) - The character was subsequently borrowed for a near-homophone meaning "must", and the original meaning came to be represented by 柲 ( OC *priɡs, *bliːɡ, *priɡ, *bliɡ ).
Unrelated to 心 , as bronze script makes clear, but in current form very similar.
