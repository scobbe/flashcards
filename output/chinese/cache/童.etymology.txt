In oracle bone inscriptions, ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 䇂 ( “ chisel ” ) + 見 ( “ kneeling person with a huge eye ” ) . It depicts a person getting their eye ( 目 ) gouged out, a common punishment for slaves in ancient China. Compare 民 , 臧 .
In bronze inscriptions, the phonetic component 東 ( OC *toːŋ ) was added, making the character phono-semantic ( 形聲 / 形声 ).
In the modern form 䇂 has corrupted into 立 . The bottom 里 derives from 東 combining with 土 , similar to 重 .
