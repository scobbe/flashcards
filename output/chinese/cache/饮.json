    "description": "Oracle: 会意—酉 “bottle” + 人 “person” + 口 “mouth (with droplets)”. Later reanalyzed as 形声—phonetic 酓 + semantic 欠; in clerical script, 酓 was remodeled to 食.",
    "interpretation": "Originally depicted someone bending over a wine vessel to drink, with dots showing drops or saliva. Subsequent script stages reinterpreted it as a phono-semantic graph with 欠 expressing the opened mouth/act, while the left element served first as a phonetic (酓) and later as the food/drink semantic (食).",
    "simplification": "食 on the left was simplified to the component 饣, yielding 饮; a standard 食→饣 left-side reduction."
