Pictogram ( 象形 ) – alternative interpretation, either an arm bending out from the side of the body, or a wooden plough. The original version was 𠠲 and the letter ㄌ in zhuyin alphabet was inspired by this character.
See also the original version of 爭 , in which another plow can be seen. Unrelated to 工 and perhaps to 耒 since they are two different tools. Also unrelated to 另 .
