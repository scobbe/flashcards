    "type": "phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "semantic: ⺮ (bamboo) + phonetic: 即.",
    "interpretation": "Combines the bamboo element with 即 as the sound, evoking the joint or node on a bamboo stalk—a natural division point. By extension it denotes a section or boundary (texts, time → “festival”) and the idea of keeping within limits, hence “to economize.”",
    "simplification": "節 was simplified to 节 by replacing the bamboo radical with 艹 and adopting 卩 as a simpler phonetic, reducing strokes while preserving the jié reading and a plant-related cue to the bamboo node sense."
