[软]
simplified form of 軟

[軟]
Originally written 輭 , a phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *njonʔ ): semantic 車 ( “ carriage ” ) + phonetic 耎 ( OC *njonʔ ) . 耎 turned into 欠 over time due to a popular variant.
The meaning of the carriage is not fully clear. It could be linked to the synonym 柔 , which indicates the wood soft enough to be cut, or it could indicate the concept of being tired and weak after dragging a heavy carriage, hence "soft"; the right component could add part of the meaning, since it originally depicts a man under the rain, hence getting soaked (perhaps while dragging a heavy carriage). The modern component 欠 depicts a man kneeling with an open mouth, perhaps while breathing due to exhaustion.
