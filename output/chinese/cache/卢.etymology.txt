[卢]
Simplified form of 盧 from the cursive script .

[盧]
Originally a pictogram ( 象形 ) – an oven. 虍 and 皿 were added in the bronze inscriptions , and the oven pictogram came to be written 田 , making the current form a phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *b·raː ): phonetic 虍 ( OC *qʰaː ) + semantic 田 ( “ pictogram of an oven ” ) + semantic 皿 ( “ vessel ” ) . This sense (“oven”) is now represented by the character 爐 ／ 炉 ( lú ).
