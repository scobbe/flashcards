    "type": "Phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "phonetic: 舁 (OC *la) + phonetic: 牙 (OC *ŋraː); both components are phonetic; closest to original form 𦥸.",
    "interpretation": "Two phonetic elements, 舁 and 牙, were combined to signal pronunciation in Old Chinese, giving a reading around *la/*ŋra. There is little to no semantic contribution from either part; early shapes like 𦥸 reflect this phonetic fusion.",
    "simplification": "Mainland simplification adopted the long-standing clerical/cursive variant 与 for 與 to reduce strokes and streamline the graph."
