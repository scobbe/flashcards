[龙]
Simplified from 𢅛 , a variant form of 龍 . 帝 is then removed, leaving out 尨 . This was simplified even further by removing two of the three strokes of 彡 .

[龍]
Pictogram ( 象形 ) – originally a serpent with a prominent whiskered mouth and eyes.
Current form developed in large seal script, with serpent’s body on right (tail at upper right, legs on right), whiskered/fanged mouth at lower left, and eyes/crown at upper left. Left side was subsequently simplified and abstracted, with some influence of 立 and ⺼ / 月 . Note that 竜 existed as a traditional variant dating back to large seal script, and figures a dragon seen face-on, rather than curled around.
Compare 𦝠 ( luó ), which represents a particular kind of dragon.
