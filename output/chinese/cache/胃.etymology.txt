According to Shuowen Jiezi , the 𡇒 character (note that this Unicode character has undergone libian simplification) atop 𦞅 is a pictogram ( 象形 ) of a stomach. While the bronze script form merely consisted of two concentric circles, an inner portion of the character was later added, namely a mutated form of the seal script character of 米 ("rice"), representing grains within the stomach (see also 鬯 ).
A 肉 component (modern radical form ⺼ , not to be confused with the unrelated 月 , a moon) was added to specialise the character. Upon transition to the clerical script form, the upper component was simplified to the unrelated 田 , which however has a reference to rice and food.
The ancient form of the character can be seen within the lower component of 𦳊 .
