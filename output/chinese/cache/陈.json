    "description": "semantic 阜 “mound” + phonetic 東 (→ 东).",
    "interpretation": "Left 阝 (from 阜) suggests ranks/arrangement along a mound or slope, aligning with meanings like “to display/arrange.” The phonetic 東 (simplified to 东) supplies the pronunciation, which remains after simplification while the semantic left side is preserved.",
    "simplification": "Replaced the phonetic 東 with its simplified form 东 to reduce strokes while keeping the semantic 阝 (from 阜) unchanged."
