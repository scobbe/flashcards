Phono-semantic compound 形聲 / 形声 ( xíngshēng ) : semantic 口 ( kǒu ) + phonetic 乞 (OC *kʰɯds, *kʰɯd).
Its original meaning is "to stutter", hence, the phonetic component could add part of the meaning since it has the phonetically borrowed meaning of "begging" (i.e., trying to talk but with difficulties).
According to folk etymologies, 乞 in this character indicates that, while stuttering, less air comes from the mouth (compare 气 , which has more traits). However, 乞 is simply a variant of 气, it originally meant "air" and was later borrowed to indicate "begging", therefore it didn't mean "less air; to stutter" or similar words and expressions.
