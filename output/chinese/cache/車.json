    "description": "Depicts a carriage viewed from above; wheels on both sides + sun shade on top -> depicted vertically with wheels as strokes and loading area marked by 田(田) (tián, \"field\") -> 車",
    "interpretation": "The character 車(chē, \"vehicle\") originally depicts a carriage from an overhead perspective. The transformation into the vertical form involved simplifying the depiction of wheels and emphasizing the loading area, marked by a field symbol, creating a streamlined pictographic representation.",
    "simplification": "The traditional character 車 was simplified to 车 by reducing the number of strokes, maintaining the overall shape of the vehicle but removing intricate details."
