Pictogram ( 象形 ): a hanging percussion instrument (bell), originally identical to the left side of 㱿 . Later phonetically borrowed to represent 南 ( OC *nuːm , “south”).
Sagart (1988) instead proposes that it is a pictogram ( 象形 ) of the front of a house. Archaeological evidence confirms that in antiquity, at least in some regions, houses were built to face south.
