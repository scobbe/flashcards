[汉]
Simplified from 漢 (elimination of right component to 又 ( yòu ) ) in the 1956 Chinese Character Simplification Scheme by the People's Republic of China. Not known to have existed prior to that.

[漢]
Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *hnaːns ): semantic 水 ( “ water ” ) + abbreviated phonetic 暵 ( OC *hnaːnʔ, *hnaːns ) or 熯 (or 難 according to Xu Shen) – name of a river in China ( 漢水 or 漢江 ). Xu Shen links the third contracted phonetic component to the ancient variant 灘 . The component to the left as a result of a contraction appears as a variant of 堇 , which is the pictogram of a screaming man burned alive as a sacrifice. It is partly unclear whether or not the phonetic component also suggests a morphological feature of the Han river (e.g., a dry river or a river that flows with difficulty) or simply indicates part of the pronunciation; Xu Shen puts no explanation.
A second ancient variant of the character reported by Xu Shen is 㵄 (perhaps analyzable as 淢 and 大 ).
The usage for the Chinese ethnicity first appeared during the Northern and Southern Dynasties, claiming the Han dynasty as one of the golden ages of Chinese history. Before the Han dynasty, the Chinese referred their land as 華夏 ("Huaxia"), and themselves as 諸華 ("various Hua people") or 諸夏 ("various people/descendants of the Xias"). "Xia" ("Summer; great, splendid") also gave the name to the first semi-legendary Chinese dynasty, the Xia Dinasty ( 夏朝 ).
