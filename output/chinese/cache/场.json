    "description": "semantic: 土 (“earth”) + phonetic: 昜 (OC *laŋ); simplified: 昜 → 𠃓",
    "interpretation": "土 contributes the sense of ground or earth, aligning with meanings like field and place. The phonetic 昜 provides the sound basis for the reading; in the simplified form, its role is retained by a reduced shape 𠃓 that preserves the phonetic cue while cutting strokes.",
    "simplification": "The traditional phonetic 昜 was replaced by a streamlined component 𠃓 to reduce stroke count while keeping 土 for meaning and a recognizable phonetic element."
