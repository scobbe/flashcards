[熊]
According to Shuowen , phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *ɢʷlɯm ): semantic 能 ( “ bear ” ) + abbreviated phonetic 炎 ( OC *ɦlam ) .
This character originally represented an onomatopoetic word ( 熊熊 ( xióngxióng , “ (of flame) raging”)). Later its semantic component 能 ( OC *nɯː, *nɯːs, *nɯːŋ, *nɯːŋʔ ), the character for the Old Chinese word "bear", was borrowed for another word. This character thus began to represent the word "bear" instead.

[態]

[态] simplified form of 態.
