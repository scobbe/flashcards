[呂]
Ji Xusheng (2014): Pictogram ( 象形 ): two blocks of metal. Original form of 鋁 (“ingot”). Later incorporated into 金 (“metal”) as a semantic component.
Shuowen interprets it as a pictogram of two vertebrae . However, the two blocks were originally disconnected, and the connecting line was only added in the seal script.
Later phonetically borrowed as an instance of jiajie ( 假借 ) to represent 膂 ( OC *ɡ·raʔ , “spine”) and 呂 ( OC *ɡ·raʔ , “music notes”). The character was later also borrowed and stylized for 予 ( OC *la, *laʔ , “I; give”).

simplified and variant form of 呂
