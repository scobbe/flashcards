[壽]
In bronze inscriptions, one of the forms is a phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 ) composed of semantic 耂 ( “ old ” ) + phonetic 𢏚 . It can additionally bear a decorative symbol ( 口 ) or two ( 口 and 又 ).
The common traditional form 壽 is evolved from the composition with the two decorative symbols, with 又 becoming 寸 .
