In the oracle bone script , an ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 弓 ( “ bow ” ) + 矢 ( “ arrow ” ) – to shoot a bow. In the bronze inscriptions , a hand ( 又 ) drawing the bowstring was added. Hence, a conservative variant is 𢎤 .
Later the bow and arrow on the left became 身 before or during the clerical script period, and the hand came to be written 寸 .
