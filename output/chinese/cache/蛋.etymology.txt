[蛋]
Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *l'aːns ): phonetic 延 ( OC *lan, *lans ) + semantic 虫 ( “ snake, insect ” ) . Hence, the non-contracted form is 蜑 . It means "egg", with a reference to snake eggs. In the current version, 延 is abbreviated to 疋 .
This character was coined at a late stage in Chinese, since it is unattested on oracle bones, bronzes, Shuowen Jiezi and Guangyun.
