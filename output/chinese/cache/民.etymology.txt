Shuowen does not have a glyph origin for this character.
Many, including Shirakawa, have claimed that it represents an eye pierced by a dagger. Sometimes explained as the original form of 盲 ( OC *mraːŋ , “blind”), but the phonetics differ too much for this to be believable.

[艮]
Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 目 ( “ eye ” ) + 人 ( “ person ” ) — a person looking back ( Ji Xusheng, 2004 ) to introduce the concept of disobedience and/or limit. Similar but unrelated to 見 .
