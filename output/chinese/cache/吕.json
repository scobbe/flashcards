  "etymology": {
    "type": "pictogram",
    "description": "Pictogram: two blocks of metal; original form of 鋁 “ingot”. Later used as a jiajie (phonetic loan) for 膂 “spine” and 呂 “music notes”; the connecting line was a later seal‑script addition.",
    "interpretation": "Two stacked squares depict paired metal ingots; the later connecting line was a scribal convention rather than part of the original image. By phonetic borrowing it came to write words for the spine and for musical pitches, which underlies its modern readings and surname use.",
    "simplification": "Simplified 吕 streamlines 呂 by removing the central connecting stroke and reducing strokes, essentially reverting to the older disconnected two‑block look noted in early forms."
