Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *siŋ ): phonetic 辛 ( OC *siŋ ) + semantic 斤 — to chop wood. Original form of 薪 ( OC *siŋ , “firewood”). The character was later borrowed to represent 新 ( OC *siŋ , “new”) as an instance of jiajie ( 假借 ).
A semantic 木 was later added in the bronze inscriptions which merged with the 辛 .
Shuowen misinterprets the character as 𣓀 + 斤 .
