  "etymology": {
    "type": "simplified from 絲",
    "description": "Simplified from 絲 via variant 𢇁; traditional 絲 is ideogrammic compound (會意): 糸 + 糸.",
    "interpretation": "Traditional 絲 combines two ‘silk/thread’ elements (糸 + 糸) to depict many fine strands, conveying the idea of silk or thread. The simplified form 丝 streamlines this by adopting the cursive/variant shape 𢇁, compressing the two threads into a single, more abstract looped form while preserving the original meaning.",
    "simplification": "Adopted a long-used handwritten/variant form (𢇁) that merges the double 糸 into one compact shape, greatly reducing strokes and improving writing speed for a very common word."
