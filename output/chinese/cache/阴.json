  "etymology": {
    "type": "phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "semantic 阜 + phonetic 侌 (yīn); simplified from 陰 by replacing 侌 with 月.",
    "interpretation": "阝 (from 阜) points to slopes/embankments, evoking the shaded side of a hill and by extension darkness, overcast weather, or concealment. 侌 originally provided the sound yīn and a notion of covering; after simplification to 月, the semantic idea persisted while the original phonetic cue was largely lost.",
    "simplification": "Adopted in 1956 by replacing the phonetic 侌 with the simpler and common component 月, reducing strokes and following an attested popular variant; 阝 preserves the semantic link to 阜."
