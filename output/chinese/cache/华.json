  "etymology": {
    "type": "phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "phonetic: 化 + semantic: 十 (“stalk and leaves”). Traditional 華 was originally a pictogram of a flowering plant, later also analyzed as phono-semantic with 于 (phonetic) + 艸 (semantic).",
    "interpretation": "In the simplified form, 化 supplies the sound huá, while 十 preserves a vestige of the plant imagery inherited from 華. The traditional form depicted a flower on a stalk and later gained a phonetic 于 with the plant marker 艸, linking the senses of ‘splendid/flowery’ and ‘Chinese.’",
    "simplification": "Top floral component of 華 was replaced by the phonetic 化 to reduce strokes and emphasize pronunciation; 华 was introduced in the 1956 PRC simplification and had no prior attested form."
