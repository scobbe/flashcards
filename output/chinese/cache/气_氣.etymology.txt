[气]
Pictogram ( 象形 ): clouds flowing through the sky.
In the oracle bone script, it was represented by three horizontal strokes, expressing the "feeling" of the sky. However, in order to avoid confusion with the number 三 ( OC *suːm, *suːms ), 气 ( OC *kʰɯds ) was changed to draw a small stroke from top to bottom.
Its variant is 乞 ( OC *kʰɯds, *kʰɯd ) and was later used to distinguish a phonetically borrowed meaning, "to beg".
Semantically unrelated to 氣 ( OC *kʰɯds, *qʰɯds ) and its variant 餼 ( OC *qʰɯds ) due to a different meaning ("give food as a gift").

[氣]
Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *kʰɯds, *qʰɯds ): phonetic 气 ( OC *kʰɯds ) + semantic 米 ( “ rice ” ) – to give rice as a gift.
Later borrowed meanings of “air, flow” from 气 ( OC *kʰɯds ). The derivative 餼 ( OC *qʰɯds ) refers to the original word. Compare 乞 ( OC *kʰɯds, *kʰɯd ).
