[㐬]
Pictogram ( 象形 ): a newborn baby, shown upside down. The upper portion is an inverted 子 . The three lower lines represent amniotic fluid or hair. The interpretation as fluid is supported by the comparison of 旒 ( liú ) and 游 ( yóu ) , originally variants of one another. (Note that the oracle bone form of 子 also depicted hair.) ( Can this ( + ) etymology be sourced ?)
