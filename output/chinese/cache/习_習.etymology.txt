[习]
Simplified from 習 (elimination of 白 and 羽 → 习 ) in the 1956 Chinese Character Simplification Scheme by the People's Republic of China. Not known to have existed prior to that.

[習]
Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 羽 ( “ wings ” ) + 日 ( “ sun ” ) – to learn to fly, to practice flying.
In the current form, 日 ( rì , “sun”) has changed to 白 ( bái , “white”), so the present form is 羽 ( “ wings ” ) + 白 ( “ white ” ) .
Alternatively, the original form may have been a phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *ljub ): phonetic 彗 ( OC *sɢʷeds, *ɢʷeds, *sɢʷids ) + semantic 日 ( “ sun ” ) .
