Shuowen : Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *tɯːns, *dɯːns ): phonetic 𡱂 ( OC *duːn ) + semantic 殳 ( “ hand holding a weapon ” ) – the sound of hitting (not attested in ancient documents).
Chi (2010) considers the character to be developed from 𠂤 (“buttocks”); 尸 (“body”) and 丌 (“pedestal”) are added to form 𡱂 (“buttocks”), and 殳 is added to emphasize the meaning of “hitting the buttocks”.
