[攴]
Pictogram ( 象形 ): a hand ( 又 ) holding a tool of some sort (possibly a weapon or whip), meaning “to hit”. The tool later corrupted into the phonetic component 卜 ( OC *poːɡ ). Today, the character is mostly stylized except in some archaic variants.
Similar but unrelated to 支 , 伊 , and 父 . The stylized version is unrelated to 囱 ( OC *sʰroːŋ, *sʰloːŋ ) (> 窗 ) and 文 .
