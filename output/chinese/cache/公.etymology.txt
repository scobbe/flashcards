The traditional interpretation as given by Han Feizi is that 公 is a compound of 八 (= 背 (“to deviate; opposite”)) and 厶 (original form of 私 (“individual; private”)), i.e. the opposite of “private” — “public”. This theory is supported by Sun Yirang and Qiang Kaiyun, despite the somewhat different shape of the bottom component from 厶 .
This is disputed in modern times by Gao Hongjin, who thinks that the 八 on top stands for 分 (“to divide; to distribute”) and the bottom round component 口 symbolises a generic object. 公 thus represents “equally dividing resources so that they are communal ”.
Another theory put forth by Zhu Fangpu is that 公 is a pictogram ( 象形 ), being the original form of 瓮 ( OC *qloːŋs , “a wide-mouthed round-bottomed jar ”), and later borrowed for the meanings of “public” and “male of older generation or higher rank”.
