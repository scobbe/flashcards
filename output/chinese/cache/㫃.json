    "description": "Pictogram: a flag on a pole with a decoration on top; in modern form the flag is detached and stylized as 方; related to 倝, unrelated to 朝; appears as 𭤨 as a side component, whose top is unrelated to 伤, 乞, 每.",
    "interpretation": "Originally depicts a banner mounted on a pole with a finial, hence the meaning ‘flag’. In regular script the banner shape was abstracted to the square-like 方 element and, when used as a side component, takes the form 𭤨 that may resemble other parts but is etymologically distinct.",
