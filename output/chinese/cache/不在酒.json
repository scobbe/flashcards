    "description": "The phrase 不在酒 (bù zài jiǔ) literally means 'not in the wine.' Its traditional meaning is explored through its parts: 不 (bù, 'not'), 在 (zài, 'in'), and 酒 (jiǔ, 'wine'). This phrase is most famously known from the Chinese idiom 酒不醉人人自醉 (jiǔ bù zuì rén rén zì zuì, 'The wine doesn’t intoxicate, people get themselves intoxicated'), suggesting that the true cause of intoxication lies not in the wine itself but in the person's mindset or emotions. Historically, this reflects the influence of Chinese philosophical thought where self-reflection and introspection were regarded as important.",
    "interpretation": "The phrase suggests that the essence of a situation is not to be found in its apparent elements; rather, it emphasizes understanding the underlying factors, such as personal intention or emotional state.",
