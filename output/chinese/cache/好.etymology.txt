Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 女 ( “ woman ” ) + 子 ( “ child ” ) .
The widely accepted meaning of this character is that the characters for “ female ” ( 女 ) and “ child ” ( 子 ) were put together to form a compound because it was good for a woman to have a child. Similarly, it has been proposed that the compound originally refers to the mutual affection between the mother and child, which then extended to mean “ good ” . These theories are supported by the smaller 子 found in some oracle bones and bronze inscriptions. See also 保 and the original version of 乳 .
However, broader interpretations of the second character 子 could lead to other theories. 子 could also mean “ son ” , so it may have meant two children, a boy and a girl next to each other, which is a good fortune to have a boy and a girl. 子 could also mean “ man ” , so it may have referred to the love between a man and a woman, which is good. Duan Yucai , in his annotated version of Shuowen , interpreted it as originally referring to the beauty of woman . Lastly, it could mean that the “ attitude ” of a girl was considered good.
