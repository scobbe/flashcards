[文]
Ideogram ( 指事 ): a man with a painted or tattooed chest – original form of 紋 . The tattoo was usually a cross, a V shape or a stylized heart. In current form, tattoo has vanished, so simply an outline of a man (head, outstretched arms, legs, chest) similar to 立 . Compare 大 , which has no chest.
Unrelated to the Kangxi radicals 齐 and 攵 .
