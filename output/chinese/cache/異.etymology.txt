Ideogram ( 指事 ) – a man with a mask ( 田 ) over his face. Possible interpretations:
• Strange, bizarre — "uncommon".
• Different face — "different".
Compare 鬼 (“demon”), where the 田 also derives from a face or a mask. Compare also 禺 , in which the top component represents either a mask or a monkey's face.
Alternatively, may be a pictogram ( 象形 ) of a person carrying something on his head, the original form of 戴 (“to carry on the head”).
Modern form is graphically 田 + 共 , though this is not the etymology.
