  "simplified": "发",

  "english": "to send out; to emit; to issue; to develop",
  "etymology": {
    "type": "phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "Originally a pictogram of a bow shooting an arrow; later + hand 攴 forming 㢭; the hand evolved into the phonetic 癹, yielding a phono-semantic compound (semantic: 弓 ‘bow’ + phonetic: 癹).",
    "interpretation": "Begins as a drawing of a bow launching an arrow, capturing the idea of sending forth. Over time a hand element was added and then simplified into the sound-bearing 癹, while 弓 kept the sense of projecting or launching, aligning with meanings like “to send out” and “to issue.”",
    "simplification": "PRC 1956 scheme reduced 發/髮 to 发 by adopting an abbreviated form of the right-side component (癹 → 发) and dropping complex parts like 弓/髟, merging two traditional characters into one simpler graph."
