    "type": "compound word",
    "description": "岭(嶺) (lǐng, \"mountain range\") refers to the geographical region south of the Five Ridges. 南(南) (nán, \"south\") specifies the direction this refers to. 文化(文化) (wénhuà, \"culture\") signifies the customs, art, social institutions, and achievements of the people in the Lingnan region. The Lingnan area, primarily covering parts of Guangdong and Guangxi, is historically known for its rich diversity influenced by both central Chinese and indigenous cultures.",
    "interpretation": "Lingnan culture is the unique set of cultural characteristics that developed in the region south of the Five Ridges, heavily influenced by both Han Chinese culture and local ethnolinguistic groups. This cultural identity is distinct due to its history of geographic isolation and interaction with foreign influences through trade.",
