[易]
Oracle bone script and bronze inscriptions : a pictogram ( 象形 ) of a filled container, the original form of 賜 ( OC *sleːɡs , “to confer, to bestow”). Possibly specialised from 益 ( OC *qleɡ , “to increase, to add”). Perhaps borrowed phonetically to mean "easy".
The character is not the pictogram of a chameleon , as folk etymology says. Unrelated to 陽 since it doesn't represent the sun .

[昜]
Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 日 ( “ sun ” ) + 丂 + 彡 . The rays of the sun over a tree branch.
