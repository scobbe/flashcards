[奐]
Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *qʰʷaːns ): abbreviated phonetic 夐 ( OC *qʰʷeːns, *qʰʷeŋs ) + semantic 廾 . The upper part indicates both ancient pronunciation and the concept of "eminent" (it contains an eye and a stick in hand representing authority), while the two hands at the bottom of the character (then stylized as 大) convey the meaning of "numerous, copious, abundant" attested on oracle bones. It was also used to represent 換 ( OC *ɢʷaːns , “to change; to swap”).
Alternatively ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 穴 ( “ yurt ” ) + 廾 ( “ hands ” ) a pair of hands opening a yurt door to let in sunlight, hence there could be a potential shift of meaning from "brilliant".
A third interpretation by Xun Zaiguo (徐在國) explains that the character indicates "to steal" or "to take objects from other people's houses", i.e., a yurt from which two hands steal/take something. This interpretation could be linked to "numerous", but it is difficult to link to "brilliant".
