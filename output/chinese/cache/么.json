  "etymology": {
    "type": "phono-semantic compound (traditional 麼); simplified 么 is a variant of 幺",
    "description": "semantic: 幺 (‘small, tiny’) + phonetic: 麻; 么 is listed as a variant of 幺.",
    "interpretation": "In the traditional form 麼, 麻 provides the sound value (ma), while 幺 contributes the meaning of smallness or indeterminacy. This semantic nuance helped it develop into a neutral suffix and interrogative/degree particle; the simplified 么 reduces the complex form to a variant shaped like 幺 for ease of writing.",
    "simplification": "Replaced complex 麼 with the simpler 么 (a variant of 幺), reducing strokes and retaining the suffixal/particle function in modern usage."
