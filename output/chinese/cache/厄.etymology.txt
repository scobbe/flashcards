[厄]
Possibly an ideogram ( 指事 ) of a person kneeling ( 卩 ), and a small stroke to accentuate the knee (now 厂 ). [ 1 ] Not cognate with 戹 (“yoke”) but eventually they shared meanings.
Shuowen Jiezi interprets it as phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *qreːɡ ): phonetic 厂 ( OC *hŋaːnʔ, *hŋaːns ) + semantic 卪 ( “ joint; node ” ) – wood knot .

[阨]
variant form of 厄
