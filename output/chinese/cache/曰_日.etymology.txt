[曰]
Ideogram ( 指事 ): a mouth ( 口 ) with word or breath ( 一 ) coming out. Compare 言 , in which a small stroke on top of a bifurcated tongue ( 舌 ) is also used to represent words; see also 四 and 只 . Unrelated to 甘 .

[日] an ancient form of 時.

[時]
Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *djɯ ): semantic 日 ( “ sun; day ” ) + phonetic 寺 ( OC *ljɯs ) . The phonetic component however represents a footprint pointing up, which could be linked to the concept of the movement of the sun and hence the passing of time.
In ancient scripts, it had the form 旹 , with 之 ( OC *tjɯ ) as the phonetic instead (as well as a reference to the passing of time). The component 寸 was added later.

[时] simplified and variant form of 時.
