[車]
Pictogram ( 象形 ) – originally a carriage seen from above. In the oracle bone script, there were large wheels on both sides and a sun shade on the top. Later, when Chinese characters were written vertically, the wheels on both sides were simply drawn in strokes and the loading area was marked with a 田 ( OC *l'iːŋ ). Therefore, it is important to understand that the current character, 車 ( OC *kʰlja, *kla ) is a vertical depiction of a carriage.
Note that 倝 ( OC *kaːns ) and 朝 ( OC *ʔr'ew, *r'ew ) are not derived from 車 ( OC *kʰlja, *kla ).
