    "type": "pictogram",
    "description": "Originally a pictogram; later used as a rebus/phonetic loan for “yellow”. Shuowen (erroneous): phonetic 炗 “light” + semantic 田 “field” (top 廿 from a corrupted 口).",
    "interpretation": "Early forms likely depicted a person or a chest-worn jade ring, and the graph was later borrowed to write the color word via rebus. Later analyses that parse it as 光/田 reflect reinterpretation; the top element traces back to an earlier 口 shape.",
    "simplification": "Component simplification reduced the complex 黃 to 黄 by collapsing the top element and removing small interior strokes; this simpler form was then generalized as a component."
