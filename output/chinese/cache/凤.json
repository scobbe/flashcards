    "type": "phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "semantic: 鳥 ‘bird’ + phonetic: 凡; simplified from 鳳 (𩾏 → 又).",
    "interpretation": "Combines the bird component 鳥 with the phonetic 凡 to name a mythic bird, with 凡 contributing the sound. In simplification, the semantic bird part was dropped and the form was streamlined around the phonetic, following the 𩾏 → 又 reduction pattern seen in bird-related characters.",
    "simplification": "The semantic 鳥 component was removed and the graph reduced to a form based on the phonetic 凡, reflecting a general policy of simplifying complex semantic components (notably the bird series) to simpler shapes."
