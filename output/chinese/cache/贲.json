    "type": "Phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "semantic: 貝 “cowry” + phonetic: 卉 for the reading bì; later borrowed to write 奔, giving the reading bēn.",
    "interpretation": "For the bì reading, 貝 contributes the semantic field of valuables/ornament while 卉 provides the sound. In antiquity the graph was also used to write the verb 奔 “to rush,” which yielded the bēn reading; today the ‘rush’ sense is mainly written 奔, while 贲/賁 survives in specialized and classical contexts.",
    "simplification": "貝 was simplified to 贝 as part of the regular script reforms; the phonetic 卉 remained unchanged."
