[柬]
Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 束 ( “ tie ” ) + 八 ( “ division, individually ” ) . Its original meaning is "to pick, to select, to choose", later written as 揀 / 拣 . Perhaps, the two points/marks inside the pictogram of the tied bag (later stylized as 八 ) mark and emphasize the content of a bag and/or the extraction of its content. See also 東 , 熏 , and 鹵 .

[東]
Jiajie ( 假借 ) and ideogram ( 指事 ): 束 ( OC *hljoɡ ) or 橐 ( OC *tʰaːɡ ) borrowed for sound 東 ( OC *toːŋ ), with a horizontal stroke added as a distinguishing mark to differentiate the character from 束.
Alternatively, it is also thought to be a pictogram ( 象形 ) of either a bundle of faggots tied together or a bag tied at both ends (like a cellophane-wrapped candy with the ends twisted).
Interpreted in the Shuowen Jiezi as an ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ) the sun ( 日 ) rising behind a tree ( 木 ). According to Allan (1991) p. 47-50, the character represents the Fu Sang tree. However, the original form is rather different, hence any interpretation tied to a tree is most likely a folk etymology.
See the top component of 曹 in the original version. See also 柬 , 熏 , 西 and 鹵 / 卤 .
