Originally 㢟 , an ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 彳 ( “ walking ” ) + 止 ( “ foot ” ) – "to travel far". The stroke at the top started being added as a distinguishing mark at the end of the Warring States period , as a way to distinguish its usage from 㢟 as an adverb to mean "prolonged", making it an Ideogram ( 指事 ).

Shuowen Jiezi interprets it as phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *lan, *lans ): phonetic 丿 ( OC *pʰleːd, *leds ) + semantic 㢟 .
