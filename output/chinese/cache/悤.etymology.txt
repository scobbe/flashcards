[悤]
The original form shows a heart ( 心 ) with a big dot on top. Qiu Xigui (裘錫圭) and Shen Pei (沈培) see the dot indicating a hole and hence its original meaning was "intelligent" ( 聰 ) – it's a traditional Chinese idea to describe intelligence as holes on the heart.
The thick dot evolved into a patterned shape 囪 in Han dynasty. For a similar phenomenon, compare 山 in Han dynasty, which also variantly has a solid filling or a patterned filling.
The character then changed meaning perhaps due to a proximity of meaning (learn fastly > hastily), but the original meaning is preserved into 聰.
