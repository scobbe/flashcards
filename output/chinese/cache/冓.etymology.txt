[冓]
Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ) – two fish ( 魚 ) with their mouths facing each other – original script of 遘 ( OC *koːs, *koːs , “to meet; to encounter”).
The erroneous interpretation of "crossly accumulated woods" given in Shuowen is a result of the corruption of the form of the character after Western Zhou.

[黃]
Chi (2010) proposes that 黃 was originally a pictogram ( 象形 ) and the original character of 尪 ( OC *qʷaːŋ , “a disabled person with a protruding chest or abdomen”). It has been phonetically borrowed for "yellow" since the era of the oracle bone script. He (1998) noted the possible ritual of burning disabled people with a protruding chest or abdomen to pray for rain as mentioned in Zuozhuan . The 口 in the upper part of the bronze inscription of 黃 might be depicting the disabled person's face facing upwards. Compare 堇 .
Li (2012) , on the other hand, proposes that 黃 was originally a pictogram ( 象形 ) and the original character of 璜 ( OC *ɡʷaːŋ , “semicircular jade”) as the 口 in the oracle bone script resembles a ring of jade, so the character would carry the meaning of "a man wearing a ring of jade on his chest". The meaning "yellow" is the result of rebus . See also the original version of 周 , which represents carved jade.
According to Shuowen , it is both a phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *ɡʷaːŋ ) and ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): phonetic 炗 ( “ light ” ) + semantic 田 ( “ field ” ) – the color of earth, with 炗 being the ancient form of 光 ( OC *kʷaːŋ, *kʷaːŋs , “light”). However, this interpretation is erroneous as 廿 at the top was formed as a result of corruption of 口 in the bronze inscription.
