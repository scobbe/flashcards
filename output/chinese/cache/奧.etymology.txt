[奧]
Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 匊 ( “ rice in a house ” ) + 𠬞 ( “ hands ” ) — to conceal and store rice in a house. [ 1 ] 匊 is unrelated to characters like 菊 , which contain an abbreviated form of 鞠 instead.
A conservative variant is 𡪃 . Shuowen interprets it as a Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *quːɡs ): semantic 宀 ( “ roof ” ) + phonetic 𢍏 ( juàn ) , but is not widely accepted.
