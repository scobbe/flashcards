    "type": "phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "semantic: 亻 (person) + phonetic: 固; simplified 个 is a graphic variant of 箇, half of 竹.",
    "interpretation": "個 combines the person element with the sound of 固 to convey the idea of a single person or unit, which extends to its use as a general classifier. The modern simplified 个 comes from an older bamboo-based variant (箇), later standardized for its simple, easily written shape.",
    "simplification": "Adopted the long-used cursive/abbreviated variant 个 (half of 竹) in place of 亻+固 from 個/箇, dropping both semantic and phonetic parts to standardize a minimal form."
