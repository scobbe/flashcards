[聰]
The character derives from its proto-form 悤 , which represents a heart/mind (心) with a big dot on top indicating a hole. According to Qiu Xigui (裘錫圭) and Shen Pei (沈培), it indicates an open heart and an open mind. Its original meaning was "intelligent". Later, it became Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *sʰloːŋ ): phonetic 囪 ( OC *sʰloːŋ ) + semantic 心 ( “ heart ” ) , hence the dot on top became the pictogram of a window.
Eventually, the character evolved into 聰, i.e., Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *sʰloːŋ ): semantic 耳 ( “ ear ” ) + phonetic 悤 ( cōng ) , in which the ear symbolizes somebody willing to listen and learn fastly through hearing.
