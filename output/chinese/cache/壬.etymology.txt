[壬]
Pictogram ( 象形 ). The original meaning is uncertain.
Proposed interpretations include:
• A weaving tool (e.g., a spool or bobbin), related to 榺 ( shèng );
• A carrying pole, making it the original form of 任 ( rèn );
• A double-bladed axe.

[千]
Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *sn̥ʰiːn ): semantic 一 ( “ one, signifying a number ” ) + phonetic 人 ( OC *njin ) . The Old Chinese pronunciations of 千 ( OC *sn̥ʰiːn ) and 人 ( OC *njin ) were similar. For the component 人 , compare its combining form 亻 .
The traditional explanation holds that the extra line indicates an extension (see the etymologies of 年 and 延 ). 千 has the meaning one thousand because one thousand is a number that is reached by extending one's counting.
