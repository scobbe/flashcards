    "description": "Unknown origin; attested as a tribal name in oracle inscriptions and later used as a number. Traditional 萬: pictogram ‘scorpion’; later phonetically borrowed to mean ‘ten thousand’.",
    "interpretation": "Meaning ‘ten thousand’ comes from a phonetic loan to the older scorpion pictograph 萬, rather than from its original pictorial meaning. The streamlined form 万 became the standard modern graph, reflecting an earlier simple variant that had already been used numerically.",
    "simplification": "Adopted as the simplified form of 萬 by selecting the already-attested low-stroke variant 万 for ease and speed of writing; it also matched historical numeric usage."
