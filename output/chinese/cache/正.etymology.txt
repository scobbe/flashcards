Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *tjeŋ, *tjeŋs ): phonetic 丁 ( OC *rteːŋ, *teːŋ ) + semantic 止 ( “ foot ” ) – to go on a long journey. Original form of 征 ( OC *tjeŋ , “to go on long campaign”).
Later, 丁 was simplified into a horizontal stroke, as in 旦 . Folk etymologies do not recognize 丁. Graphically, the modern version of the character is the reverse of 之 .
