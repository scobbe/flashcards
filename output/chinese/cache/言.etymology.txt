Ideogram ( 指事 ): 言 was created by adding a horizontal stroke to the top of the ancient version of 舌 to indicate movement of the tongue. [ 1 ] This indicates speech, where 舌 is a mouth ( 口 ) with a forked tongue sticking out; hence 舌 doesn't indicate the speech, but the tongue as an organ of the body. In the modern version, another horizontal stroke (then stylized as a point) was added on top and the vertical body of the tongue disappeared. See also 音 .
Shuowen erroneously analyzes the glyph as a phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 ): phonetic 䇂 ( qiān ) + semantic 口 ( “ mouth ” ) .
