    "type": "Phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "semantic: 氵 (“water”) + phonetic: 京",
    "interpretation": "Combines a water/ice semantic with the phonetic 京, so the pronunciation follows 京 while the meaning points to coolness, coldness, or fluids. In modern simplified form, the semantic side appears as 冫 “ice,” reinforcing the ‘cool/cold’ sense without changing pronunciation.",
    "simplification": "In simplified 凉, the water radical 氵 was replaced by the ice radical 冫 to reduce strokes and better match the ‘cold’ meaning, while retaining 京 as the phonetic."
