    "description": "馬(馬) (mǎ, \"horse\") providing the meaning of riding + 奇(奇) (qí, \"strange\") providing the phonetic element -> riding a horse -> to ride",
    "interpretation": "The character uses the semantic component 馬(馬) (mǎ, \"horse\") to indicate the act of riding a horse, combined with the phonetic component 奇(奇) (qí, \"strange\") to suggest the pronunciation. This combination effectively conveys the concept of riding, typically on horseback.",
    "simplification": "The traditional 騎 was simplified to 骑 by removing the 馬(馬) (mǎ, \"horse\") radical and replacing it with its simpler form 马(马) (mǎ, \"horse\"), maintaining the essential meaning and readability."
