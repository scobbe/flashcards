[號]
Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *ɦlaːw, *ɦlaːws ): phonetic 号 ( OC *ɦlaːws ) + semantic 虎 ( “ tiger ” ) .
Originally an ideogram ( 指事 ) of a tiger and a line representing its roar, hence exhaled air while roaring. Later forms added 口 (“mouth”) or 言 (“speech”) to emphasize the act of crying or calling. The original meaning was "to roar; to shout". 号 derives from 口 and the line 丂 .
