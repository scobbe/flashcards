  "etymology": {
    "type": "phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "semantic: 艹 (plant) + phonetic: 闌",
    "interpretation": "This character is a phono-semantic compound where the 艹 (cǎo, grass) indicates that it is related to plants, specifically flowers. The phonetic component 闌 (lán, stop) suggests the pronunciation of the character, which aligns with words related to beauty and refinement, like orchids. The visual form of 兰 reflects a streamlined version suitable for modern usage while maintaining its botanical essence.",
    "simplification": "兰 was simplified from 蘭 by removing the 门 (mén, gate) component of the phonetic part 闌, likely due to the principle of simplification through component reduction. This simplification aligns with making characters easier to write while retaining phonetic elements from traditional to simplified forms."
