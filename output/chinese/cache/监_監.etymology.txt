[监]
Simplified from 監 ( 臣 → 〢 ); compare 览 .

[監]
Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 臥 ( “ a person with an emphasized eye ” ) + 皿 ( “ container ” ) : a person looking into a container ( Ji Xusheng, 2004 ). Original form of 鑑 ( OC *kraːm, *kraːms, *kraːms , “mirror”). The container later corrupted into 血 ; in the regular script, this additional stroke has migrated to below the 人 → ⿱𠂉丶 / ⿱𠂉一 .
