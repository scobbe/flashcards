Pictogram ( 象形 ) – a kind of agricultural tool used for tilling the fields and removing weeds ( Guo, 1931 ; Qiu, 1992 ), possibly made of a kind of large clam 蜃 ( OC *djɯns, *djɯnʔ, *djins ) ( Guo, 1931 ).
Alternatively, it could be a pictogram ( 象形 ) of a person holding onto a cliff – original character of 振 ( OC *tjɯn, *tjɯns , “to hold up”) ( Shang, 1983 ).
