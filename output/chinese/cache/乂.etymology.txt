[乂]
Pictogram ( 象形 ) — a tool similar to a knife ( Li Xueqin, 2012 ), perhaps a sickle; see also 辛 . In some other versions both on oracle bones and bronzes, it looks like a huge pair of scissors used to cut weed. The original meaning of "mow, cut weed; sickle" is preserved in 刈 . Unrelated to 爻 .

[义]
Derived from 乂 . Originally 乂 was borrowed because of homophony and being mostly displaced by ( 刈 ). Later, to avoid confusion a stroke was added on top of 乂 to distinguish correctly. Now a homophonic character; compare 舊 → 旧
