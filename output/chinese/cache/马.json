    "type": "pictogram",
    "description": "Pictogram: a horse with head facing left and flowing mane; in bronze, the head simplified to 目; legs evolved into four dots 灬 (unrelated to 火). Simplified 马 from 馬 via cursive script.",
    "interpretation": "Originally a sketch of a horse that gradually stylized its head and legs into simple strokes. Modern simplification to 马 follows a cursive handwriting form, compressing the body and abstracting the legs into a single sweeping shape.",
    "simplification": "Reduced from 馬 based on cursive (草书) form to speed writing, cutting strokes from about 10 to 3 and standardized in the PRC."
