The bronze inscription was in the form of 門 (“door”) + 卝 (“locked door; two wooden sticks to lock a door”). 卝 might also serve as a phonetic component. The whole character represents a door locked with two wooden sticks.
Then, the character slightly evolved into Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *kroːn ): semantic 門 ( “ door ” ) + phonetic 𢇅 , in which two couples of rings similar to 幺幺 are visible on top of the two wooden sticks.

Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *qroːn ): semantic 弓 ( “ bow ” ) + phonetic 䜌 ( OC *b·roːn, *b·ron, *b·rons ) .
