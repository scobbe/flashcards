  "etymology": {
    "type": "Phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "semantic 辵 (“walk”) + phonetic 咼",
    "interpretation": "Movement is signaled by the walking radical 辶/辵, fitting senses like passing, crossing, or going beyond. The phonetic 咼 supplies the sound value guo-, a phonetic shared with characters such as 渦 and 蝸.",
    "simplification": "Traditional 過 was simplified to 过 by reducing 辵 to 辶 and collapsing the complex phonetic 咼 to a simpler right-side form (often analyzed as 寸), reflecting cursive/abbreviated handwriting; the original phonetic transparency was largely sacrificed for fewer strokes."
