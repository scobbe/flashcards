    "description": "Semantic 辵(辶) (chuò, \"walk\") + phonetic 咼(咼) (guō) = walking/passing -> exceed/pass through",
    "interpretation": "過(過) (guò, \"exceed; pass through\") combines the walking radical 辵(辶) (chuò, \"walk\") with the phonetic 咼(咼) (guō), suggesting the concept of moving past or over something. This aligns with the meanings of exceeding limits or passing through a place.",
    "simplification": "The character 过 was simplified by removing the top part of 辵(辶) (chuò, \"walk\"), reducing the character to three strokes in 过."
