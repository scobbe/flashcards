[手]
Pictogram ( 象形 ) – hand and fingers. The top stroke is the bent over middle finger, while the horizontal strokes are each two fingers. Compare 爪 , 寸 , 九 , 又 , and 彐 as a stylized hand. Compare 丑 as an animal claw. See also the bottom part of 举 and 奉 .
Note that unlike the other hand/claw characters, 手 has consistently had five fingers: a mammalian/human hand, as opposed to the three digits often found in the others.
Compare also 止 (“foot”), derived from a footprint pointing upward, originally composed of 3 toes and a sole.

[爪]
Pictogram ( 象形 ) – a hand grabbing from above (in earlier forms from side); compare 手 , 寸 , 九 . Even if it can indicate a claw, actually the pictogram depicts a human hand.

[爫]
Component form of 爪 .
