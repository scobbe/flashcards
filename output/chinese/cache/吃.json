    "interpretation": "Combines the mouth component 口 with the sound-bearing 乞, tying the graph to actions involving the mouth. Its early sense was “to stutter,” with 乞 contributing the sound and, via later borrowing as “beg,” a nuance linked to halting speech; the folk idea of “less air” is incorrect since 乞 was originally a variant of 气 meaning “air.”",
