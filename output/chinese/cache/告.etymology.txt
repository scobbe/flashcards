[告]
Unclear. Theories include:
• Zhongshu Xu: Pictogram ( 象形 ): tongue sticking out from the mouth. [ 字源 1 ]
• Meilan Chen: Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): abbreviated 壴 + 口 , hence a decorated drum and an open mouth. [ 字源 2 ]
Shuowen interprets it as 牛 + 口; however, Yu Xingwu points out that the top component is unrelated to 牛 , as can seen in the oracle bone script and bronze inscriptions. [ 字源 3 ]
