[青]
Zhang (2022): Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *sʰleːŋ ): phonetic 生 ( OC *sʰleːŋ, *sreŋs ) + phonetic 井 ( OC *skeŋʔ ) . [ 1 ]
Shuowen interprets it as an ideogrammic compound of 生 (“growth of plants”) + 丹 (“ cinnabar ”). A variant inspired by this interpretation is 𤯞 . The implication being that cinnabar, being used for dyeing, would imply “color” in general, giving the combined meaning “color of growing plants” → “blue-green”.
In the modern glyph, the top component is reduced to 龶 , and the bottom component resembles the unrelated 月 ( yuè , “ moon ” ) .
The second-round simplified form of the character is based on the calligraphic form of the character.
