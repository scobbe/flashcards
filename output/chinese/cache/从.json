    "interpretation": "The character 从(cóng, \"from\") visually depicts two people walking in the same direction, symbolizing following someone. In its traditional form, 從(cong, \"follow\") added the \"walk\" radical to reinforce the idea of movement and accompaniment.",
    "simplification": "从 was retained as a shorthand for 從 by omitting the 辵(辵) (chuò, \"walk\") radical, preserving its original depiction of two people walking."
