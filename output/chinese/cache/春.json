    "type": "phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "semantic: 艸 ‘grass’ + phonetic: 屯 ‘sprout’ + semantic: 日 ‘sun’; intermediate form 萅; 艸 and 屯 later merged into 𡗗; also used as a variant of 屯 for ‘spring’ in Old Chinese.",
    "interpretation": "Combines grass and sun with the sound-bearing 屯, evoking plants sprouting under sunlight—the essence of spring’s growth. Over time, 艸 and 屯 fused into 𡗗 above 日, streamlining the graph. Early literature sometimes used it interchangeably with 屯 to mean the season of spring.",
