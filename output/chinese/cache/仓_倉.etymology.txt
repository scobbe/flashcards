[倉]
In oracle bone and bronze inscriptions, pictogram ( 象形 ): a granary, depicting its roof ( 亼 ), a door ( 戶 ), and a pit for storing grain ( 口 ). Alternatively an ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 合 ( “ gather ” ) + 戶 ( “ door ” ) – a warehouse. The component 戶 corrupted into 𠁣 in Qin bamboo slips. This form was inherited in small seal script and was misinterpreted as cognate with the unrelated 食 in the Shuowen Jiezi .
