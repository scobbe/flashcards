[保]
In the oracle script, this character was an ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 人 ( “ person ” ) + 子 ( “ child ” ) – a person carrying a child on his back; to carry (a child) > to protect. See also 好 .
In early bronze inscriptions, 爪 (“hand”) was added to the person to emphasize that the person was carrying the child. This was later simplified into one or two strokes. The current form has two.
