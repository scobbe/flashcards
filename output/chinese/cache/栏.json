    "type": "Phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "semantic: 木 (wood) + phonetic: 闌 (OC *ɡ·raːn)",
    "interpretation": "The character 栏 (simplified from 欄) represents objects made of wood, utilizing the 木 (mù, wood) component to suggest materials associated with construction, such as fences or railings. The phonetic component 闌 (làn) helps convey the pronunciation, although it carries a different meaning related to barriers or obstructions. This character effectively combines the concepts of wood and barrier for its current meaning.",
    "simplification": "Simplified by replacing the original phonetic component 闌 with 兰 (lán), which is visually simpler."
