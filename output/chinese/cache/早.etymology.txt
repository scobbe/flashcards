Early bronze inscriptions: Pictogram ( 象形 ) – acorn. Original form of 皂 ( OC *zuːʔ ) through an intermediate variant 皁 (once also written as 草 ( cǎo ) ). Borrowed phonetically for "morning" sense.
Late bronze inscriptions: Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *ʔsuːʔ ): semantic 日 ( “ sun ” ) + phonetic 棗 ( OC *ʔsuːʔ ) , with 棗 sometimes simplified as 朿 .
Small seal script: Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 日 ( “ sun ” ) + 甲 ( “ first ” ) – when the sun first rises. However, Xu Shen's interpretation is not based on oracle bones and bronzes inscriptions.
In some ancient texts, 蚤 ( OC *ʔsuːʔ ) was often used instead.
Unrelated to the ancient version of 是 : in this character, it doesn't represent an acorn but a spoon.
