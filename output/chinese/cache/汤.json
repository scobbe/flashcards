    "description": "semantic: 氵 ‘water’ + phonetic: 昜",
    "interpretation": "Water component flags a liquid substance, while the phonetic 昜 historically guides the pronunciation and evokes rising heat or brightness. Together they point to hot water or broth, matching the sense of soup.",
    "simplification": "Right-side phonetic 昜 was abbreviated to 𠃓 in the simplified form 汤, reducing strokes while retaining the water semantic on the left; this follows a broader series of 昜-based simplifications (e.g., 揚→扬)."
