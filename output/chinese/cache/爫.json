    "interpretation": "The character 爫(爪) (zhuǎ, 'hand, claw') historically represented a human hand depicted from a side view, grabbing something, although it can extend its meaning to indicate a claw. This visual depiction closely associates with functions performed by a hand or a claw, making the graphical representation intuitive as both human and animal hands or claws engage in similar grasping actions.",
