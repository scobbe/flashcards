    "interpretation": "The character derives from a combination of components suggesting the act of seizing something wet with bare hands. Over time, its meaning broadened and was later reinterpreted to represent the concept of abundance or greatness. The fusion of components reflects the evolution of its meaning from physical action to abstract notions of safety and prominence.",
