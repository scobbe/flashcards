  "etymology": {
    "type": "Phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "phonetic 爿 + semantic 肉 (‘meat’) + semantic 寸 (‘hand’) — offering meat as tribute; ⺼ is on its side (resembles 夕), and 爿 may also suggest a cutting board/altar.",
    "interpretation": "A hand presenting meat suggests offering or bringing something forward, which underlies senses like ‘to lead/bring’ and later ‘will’. 爿 supplies the sound and can also evoke the board or altar on which the meat is set.",
    "simplification": "将 streamlines 將 by keeping the phonetic 爿 as its left-side form 丬, reducing ⺼ to 夕, and dropping 寸, preserving pronunciation cues while cutting strokes."
