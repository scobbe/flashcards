    "description": "semantic: 手 (“hand”) + phonetic: 員 (→ 员)",
    "interpretation": "Hand component points to actions done with the hands, leading to senses of harming, reducing, or handling something. 員/员 serves as the phonetic cue, though the modern reading sǔn only loosely reflects it. Together they express causing loss or decrease through action or impact.",
    "simplification": "員 was simplified to 员, reducing strokes in the phonetic component while keeping the overall phono-semantic structure."
