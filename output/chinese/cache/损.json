  "etymology": {
    "type": "phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "semantic: 扌(手) (shǒu, \"hand\") + phonetic: 員(员) (yuán, \"member\") = action involving hands affecting people -> decrease, damage",
    "interpretation": "损(損) (sǔn, \"decrease; damage\") combines 扌(手) (shǒu, \"hand\") suggesting a manual or active process, with 員(员) (yuán, \"member\") providing the sound element. The hand indicates an activity or operation, and 員(员) points to an action affecting individuals, together implying the notion of causing decrease or damage.",
    "simplification": "損 (sǔn, \"decrease; damage\") was simplified by replacing the more complex 員(員) with its modern simplified form 员(员) while retaining the core structure of the character."
