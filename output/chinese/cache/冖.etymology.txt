[冪]
Originally written as 幎 : Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *meːɡ ): semantic 巾 ( “ cloth ” ) + phonetic 冥 ( OC *meːŋ ) ; Xu Shen indicates that the character 幎 means "幔", "tent" (today written as 帷幕).
Later the 六 was corrupted to 大 and the radical was written under the character, thus it became 幂 .
艹 was added to form a new phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *meːɡ ): semantic 巾 ( “ cloth ” ) + phonetic 幕 ( OC *maːɡ ) .
