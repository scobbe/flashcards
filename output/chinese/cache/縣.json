    "description": "目(目) (mù, \"eye/head\") + 木(木) (mù, \"tree\") + 糸(糸) (sī, \"string\") = hanging a head by string on a tree -> referred to 懸(xuán, \"to hang\") -> later borrowed for 縣 (xuán, \"county\")",
    "interpretation": "The character 縣 originally depicted the head (eye) being hung by a string on a tree, symbolizing the action of hanging. This character was later borrowed for administrative divisions, likely due to the phonetic similarity to 懸(xuán, \"to hang\"). Over time, the original representation was adapted and corrupted, but the connotations of oversight and governance (like an overseer hanging over an area) may have influenced its adoption for 'county.'",
    "simplification": "The traditional character 縣 was simplified to 县 by removing 糸(糸) (sī, \"string\") and simplifying the components for ease of writing, while retaining phonetic aspects."
