Pictogram ( 象形 ) - a tripod , i.e., an ancient bronze vessel with three legs used for cooking or performing ritual sacrifices. Sometimes, it was carved with characters. Also phonetically (and perhaps semantically) borrowed to indicate "to divine" (then written as 鼑 > 貞 ). See also the original version of 具 and 則 .
