[土]
Pictogram ( 象形 ): a lump of clay either on the ground or on a potter’s wheel. See the bottom part of the original version of 生 and 丰 . Then, the lump of clay was stylized as a vertical stroke with a black dot in the middle perhaps to avoid confusion with other characters. Eventually, the black dot turned into a short horizontal stroke. Compare the top part of 土 with the ancient version of 十 , which is a vertical stroke with a black dot in the middle.
Unrelated to the top component of 夌 , 走 , and 周 ; also unrelated to the central component of 金 and the overall character 圭 .

[士]
Pictogram ( 象形 ) – a war axe. Later, it took the meaning of "soldier" and eventually "officer, intellectual". Partly related to 王 since in at least two characters it should represent a ritual axe, perhaps made of jade: in fact, it is related to 圭 and 金 despite their appearance.
