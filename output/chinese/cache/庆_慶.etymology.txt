[庆]
Simplified from 慶 (elimination of bottom right component to 大 ) in the 1956 Chinese Character Simplification Scheme by the People's Republic of China. This character is not known to have existed prior to that.

[慶]
In oracle bone inscriptions Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 廌 ( “ antelope ” ) + 心 . The component 心 signified goodness, blessings and auspiciousness.
In bronze inscriptions 心 is often also written as 文 . During the Warring states period, the tail of 廌 corrupted into 个 , then further into 夂 during the Qin dynasty. Based on the overlap between the many ancient variants of the character Ji, Xusheng (2004) suggests that 麕 , 廌 , 麐 , 鹿 all refer to kinds of deer – beautiful and therefore worth celebrating when obtained. He also concludes that there is enough evidence that 慶 and 麐 were once the same character. Since 麐 was the most precious among deer, its character was used to express celebration.
