    "interpretation": "Meaning comes from the speech element 言, while 永 provides the yǒng sound. In simplified, 口 replaces 言 but still signals vocalization, with 永 continuing to supply the pronunciation.",
    "simplification": "The semantic 言 was replaced by 口 to reduce strokes and emphasize mouth/vocalization, while retaining 永 as the phonetic; this aligns with simplification patterns that swap complex speech components for simpler ones."
