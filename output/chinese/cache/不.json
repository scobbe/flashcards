    "interpretation": "Originally a drawing of a flower’s calyx, the graph later acquired the meaning ‘not’ when it participated in the formation of 否 (“mouth” + 不) for negation, and that sense was transferred back to 不. The botanical meaning was reassigned to 柎, while some traditional scholars reimagined the form as a bird flying upward toward the sky line to evoke the idea of negation.",
