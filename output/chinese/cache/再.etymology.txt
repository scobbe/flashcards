• Ji Xusheng: Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 魚 ( “ fish ” ) + 二 ( “ two ” ) – to catch two fish at once ( kill two birds with one stone ). [ 2 ] Compare the oracle bone script form of 亟 .
• Xu Shen: Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 一 ( “ one ” ) + abbreviated 冓 – to catch two fish at once. [ 3 ]
• Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 一 + 冓 ( “ the shape of a basket repeatedly woven from bamboo ” ) . It signifies the concept of repeating something that was once done, conveying the meaning of "again." [ 4 ]
