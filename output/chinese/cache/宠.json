    "type": "phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "semantic: 宀(宀) (mián, \"roof\") + phonetic: 龍(龙) (lóng, \"dragon\") = protection under a roof granted to a revered creature -> favor; pamper",
    "interpretation": "The character combines the sheltering element 宀(宀) (mián, \"roof\") with the phonetic and majestic 龍(龙) (lóng, \"dragon\"), conveying the idea of special attention or privilege granted to someone cherished, like a dragon sheltered in a house.",
    "simplification": "寵(寵) was simplified to 宠(宠) by reducing 龍(龙) to a more cursive and phonetic form that still resembles the association with protection or favor."
