  "simplified": "运",
  "traditional": "運",

  "english": "to transport; to move; to run/operate; luck/fortune",
  "etymology": {
    "type": "Phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "semantic 辵 (\"motion\") + phonetic 軍",
    "interpretation": "The walking/motion component signals meanings related to movement, transport, or circulation. 軍 supplies the sound value and also evokes organized movement, which fits senses like transporting or operating. Over time this phonetic link helped extend usage to ideas like running/operating and luck/fortune in compounds.",
    "simplification": "Traditional 運 was simplified to 运 by replacing the phonetic 軍 with the simpler 云 while retaining the 辶 ‘walk’ element, reducing stroke count and keeping a similar phonetic cue."
