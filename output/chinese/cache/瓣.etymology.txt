Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *breːns ): phonetic 辡 ( OC *prenʔ, *brenʔ ) + semantic 瓜 ( “ melon ” ) . However, the phonetic component (the reduplication of the knife to mark prisoners) perhaps symbolizes two prisoners accusing each other, which then leads to the concept of "discrimination, differentiation" and finally to the concept of "part, segment, what is differentiated", originally referred to melon seeds.
