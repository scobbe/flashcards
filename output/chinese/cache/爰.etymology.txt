[爰]
Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 爫 ( “ hand, claw ” ) + 又 ( “ hand ” ) – the middle component has taken various forms.

[爱]
A variant of 愛, replacing the lower half with 友 ('friend').

[愛]
Originally 㤅 ( xì ) , a phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *qɯːds ): phonetic 旡 ( OC *kɯds ) + semantic 心 ( “ heart ” ) . However, the phonetic component indicates somebody kneeling with an open mouth, perhaps, trilling.
As early as the Qin dynasty, a meaningless component 夊 ( suī , “ foot ” ) was added to the bottom of the character, as with some other characters depicting people. Compare 憂 / 忧 ( yōu ) (from 㥑 ). Hence, the character changed into 𢙴 .
Further corruption of the top component of 𢙴 turned the original phonetic 旡 ( jì ) into ⿱爫冖 .
