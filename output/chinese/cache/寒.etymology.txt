Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 宀 ( “ house ” ) + 人 ( “ person ” ) + 茻 ( “ grass ” ) – a person in a house, sleeping in the grass to protect from the cold. In some bronze inscriptions, 二 is added at the bottom of the character; this may simply be decorative or may represent a mat. In the seal script, 二 is changed to 仌 (“ice”) to emphasize its meaning of coldness.
