Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 𠂇 ( “ left hand ” ) + 又 ( “ right hand ” ) – both hands. Also written 𠬞 .
Often stylized as 八 at the bottom of a character, e.g., 兵 , 共 , 具 , and 兴 (which however is unrelated to the legs of a table in 其 , 真 , and 典 ). See also the top component of 學 . Eventually, see the top component of 泰 , 奉 , 奏 , and 秦 in their original version.
Slightly conservative variant of 廿 ( niàn ) .
