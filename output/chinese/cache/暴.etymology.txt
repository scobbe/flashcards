[暴]
Its original form is 𫻺 and can be seen on oracle bone script; ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 虎 ( “ tiger ” ) + 戈 ( “ weapon ” ) – violence. The character also means "to expose to the sun", but its most archaic form does not convey this particular meaning.
However, by the time of bamboo slip script, usage of 𫻺 had been replaced entirely by phonetically borrowing 㬥 . This new character originates from the proto-form 𮲡, an ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 日 ( “ sun ” ) + 共 ( “ hands lifting an object ” ) ; in this precise case, the hands are lifting a plant graphically similar to 丰 or 出 . 米 (“rice”) was later added to emphasize the meaning of drying things out in the sun since rice and similar plants can be dried out in the sun. Eventually, the bottom component was stylized as the unrelated 水 and the whole character was stylized into 暴 : the plant is no more visible in the new version.
The meaning "to expose to the sun" is preserved in 𣌑 > 曝 .

[異]
Ideogram ( 指事 ) – a man with a mask ( 田 ) over his face. Possible interpretations:
• Strange, bizarre — "uncommon".
• Different face — "different".
Compare 鬼 (“demon”), where the 田 also derives from a face or a mask. Compare also 禺 , in which the top component represents either a mask or a monkey's face.
Alternatively, may be a pictogram ( 象形 ) of a person carrying something on his head, the original form of 戴 (“to carry on the head”).
Modern form is graphically 田 + 共 , though this is not the etymology.

[异] simplified form of 異.
