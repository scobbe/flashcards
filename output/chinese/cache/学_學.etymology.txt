[学]
simplified and variant form of 學

[學]
Possibly a phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *ɡruːɡ ): phonetic 爻 ( OC *ɢraːw ) + phonetic 六 ( OC *ruɡ ) . Later, 𦥑 was added to form 𦥯 , and a semantic 子 (“child”) was added for differentiation.
Another explanation is abbreviated 敎 ( “ to teach ” ) + 𦥑 ( “ mingling hands; hands-on learning ” ) + 宀 ( “ house; roofed building ” ) – a child learning in a roofed place. However, the oracle bone script does not include a child.
In the modern form, 六 has corrupted to 冖 (“cover”), and the hands 𦥑 around the 爻 have become connected with the 冖. Shuowen regards 𦥑 as the phonetic component in the character, which may be true according to some Old Chinese reconstructions such as that of Pan Wuyun 's, though probably not others.
See also the top component of 覺 , which is a contraction of 學.
