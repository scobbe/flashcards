[徒]
Small seal script: Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *l'aː ): semantic 辵 ( “ walk ” ) + phonetic 土 ( OC *l̥ʰaːʔ, *l'aːʔ ) . Later corrupted into 彳 + 走 .

[徙]
During the Zhou dynasty, 徙 was represented with the phonetic borrowing 屎 ( OC *hliʔ, *hri , “excrement”), with the components 辵 and 止 later being added to differentiate the character used to represent "migration". During the Warring States period, the earlier forms of 屎 consisting of 小 or 少 components (as seen in and ) had these portions transform into 米 , however 徙 continued to retain the 少 form. The Chu script form of 屎 corrupted into a form with the 尸 ("body") component becoming 尾 ("tail"), [ 1 ] while the Qin script form of 徙 omitted the 尸 component of 屎 and left only 少 remaining. [ 1 ] Li Shoukui (2015) however argues that the Chu script ⿸尾少 may not actually be cognate to ⿸尸少 (and ergo 屎 ). [ 1 ] The clerical script form inherited the Qin script form, however had the 少 component mutate into another 止 , [ 1 ] which coincidentally resulted in the clerical form matching the same character structure as 歨 (the Shang dynasty form of 步 ) with an additional 彳 component.
Shuowen Jiezi erroneously takes this mutated clerical script form of 徙 with two 止 components, and claims that it is a phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *selʔ ): semantic 辵 ( “ walk ” ) + phonetic 止 ( OC *kjɯʔ ) . It also omits one of the 止 components to create an alternative form 𢓊 , however no such character exists in ancient writing (although coincidentally it has a similar shape to the Shang and Zhou 延 ). Hu Houxuan (1981) states that the "ancient script" form of 徙 in Shuowen , 𡲴 , comes from a corruption of the variant form featuring 尾 in place of 尸 , but with the tail portion misrepresented as 火 . [ 1 ] For this reason, the "ancient script" forms of 徙 provided in Shuowen are extremely corrupted.
Li Jiahao (2010) notes that the ancient form of 屎 , namely ⿸尸少 , may potentially suggest that 徙 is a phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *selʔ ): semantic 辵 ( “ walk ” ) + abbreviated phonetic 沙 ( OC *sraːl, *sraːls ) . [ 1 ]
