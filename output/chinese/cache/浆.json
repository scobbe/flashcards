    "description": "semantic: 氵(氵) (shuǐ, 'water') + phonetic: 將(将) (jiāng, 'lead') = thick water-based substance -> thick liquid; starch; broth",
    "interpretation": "The character 浆(漿) (jiāng, 'thick liquid') combines the water radical 氵(氵) (shuǐ, 'water'), which suggests a liquid, with the phonetic component 將(将) (jiāng, 'lead'), to convey the idea of a water-based liquid that is thicker, such as broth or starch.",
    "simplification": "漿(漿)→浆(漿): Simplified by reducing 將(将) (jiāng, 'lead') to the left component 几(几) (jī, 'small table'), retaining the similar phonetic reading."
