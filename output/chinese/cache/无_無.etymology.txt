[无]
One of the three characters ( 無 , 无 , 亡 ) that have historically been used to represent the word "no, not any". First attested in the Warring States period ; used interchangeably with 無 until the Tang dynasty . Readopted by the PRC in 1956.
The origin of this character is unknown. Probably an ancient variant form of either 元 , 天 or 堯 . This character must not be confused with 旡 .
