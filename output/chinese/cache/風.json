    "description": "鳳(鳳) (fèng, \"fenghuang\") borrowed for sound to represent 風(風) (fēng, \"wind\") -> bronze inscription phonetic 凡 (top) + three fur-like threads (bottom) -> later forms simplified fur -> 虫 misinterpretation as insects",
    "interpretation": "The character 風(風) (fēng, \"wind\") originally borrowed the sound from 鳳(鳳) (fèng, \"fenghuang\"), a mythical bird, and eventually evolved by simplifying the depiction of fur to represent wind. Its correct interpretation focuses on sound association rather than its visual components being insects.",
    "simplification": "风 is a simplification of 風 where 䖝 is replaced with 㐅 to create a more streamlined form."
