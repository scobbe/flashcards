[由]
Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *lɯw ): phonetic 十 ( OC *ɡjub ) + semantic 口 ( “ mouth ” ) – a container with on top the pictogram of a needle ( 十 , today 針 ), to indicate the ancient pronunciation. Compare the bottom part of the original version of 缶 , an earthenware pot. In oracle bones, 由 was used as the original version of 怞 ( yóu or, in the less conservative pronunciation, chóu ). See also 俞 .
Otherwise, according to Tang Lan (唐蘭), it's the pictogram of a helmet. If a helmet, may have been the same as or original character of 冑 . However, this alternative interpretation is less likely.
