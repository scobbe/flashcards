    "description": "戈(戈) (gē, \"spear\") + 戈(戈) (gē, \"spear\") facing each other = original form of 殘(殘) (cán, \"to damage; to destroy\") -> one spear turned to same direction -> 戔(戔)",
    "interpretation": "The character 戔(戔) originally depicted two spears facing each other, symbolizing conflict or destruction, which intuitively linked to the meaning of damage or destruction. Later, one of the spears was oriented in the same direction, refining the visual representation of the concept while retaining the core idea of confrontation leading to damage.",
    "simplification": "戔(戔) was simplified to 戋(戋) by modifying the character's stroke components to create a more streamlined and cursive form, reducing visual complexity."
