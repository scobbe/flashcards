    "type": "phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "semantic: 耂 ‘old’ + phonetic: 𢏚; sometimes with decorative 口 or 口 and 又 (又 later became 寸 in 壽).",
    "interpretation": "Meaning draws on the ‘old’ element to denote long life, while 𢏚 supplies the sound. Early forms sometimes added 口 and 又 as ornamentation, with 又 later regularized as 寸 in the traditional form. The simplified form drops these ornamental elements for a cleaner structure.",
    "simplification": "Adopted an existing abbreviated/ancient variant 寿 that omits the decorative 口 and compresses the interior into a 寸-based shape, greatly reducing strokes."
