    "interpretation": "The character 草(cǎo, \"grass\") combines the semantic component 艹(艹), representing \"grass,\" with the phonetic component 早(早) which was originally used for \"acorn.\" The phonetic was borrowed to represent the sound for the word \"grass.\" This process shows how the character evolved from its original meaning to its current usage.",
