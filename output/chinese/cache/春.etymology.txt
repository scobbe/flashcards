[春]
Originally phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *tʰjun ): semantic 艸 ( “ grass ” ) + phonetic 屯 ( OC *duːn, *tun , “ sprout ” ) + semantic 日 ( “ sun ” ) . However, the sprout as a phonetic component can be another reference to plants growing. The sun was added later, thus leading to the intermediate version 萅 . Eventually, 艸 and 屯 merged into 𡗗 .
The character 春 itself is probably a variant of 屯 ( OC *duːn, *tun ) as they are equivalent for the meaning “spring” in Old Chinese literature. Unrelated to 泰 .

[萅]
