    "type": "simplified from 區",
    "description": "區(區) (qū, \"district\") originally consists of 匸(匸) (xì, \"box\") + 品(品) (pǐn, \"many people\") = representation of multiple people within an enclosed area -> simplification: 品(金) (pǐn, \"many people\") changed to 乂(乂) (yì, \"to govern\") for ease",
    "interpretation": "The character 區(區) (qū, \"district\") visually represented an area containing many people, signifying a district. The simplification to 区(區) (qū, \"district\") replaced 品(品) (pǐn, \"many people\") with 乂(乂) (yì, \"to govern\") which is visually less complex and more cursive-friendly.",
    "simplification": "The original character 區(區) (qū, \"district\") was simplified to 区(區) (qū, \"district\") by replacing 品(品) (pǐn, \"many people\") with the simpler 乂(乂) (yì, \"to govern\"), making it easier to write and remember while maintaining the sense of an enclosed area."
