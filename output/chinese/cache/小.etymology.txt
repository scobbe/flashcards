Two possible interpretations:
• Ideogram ( 指事 ) – three small dots > small.
• Pictogram ( 象形 ) – three granules of sand – original character of 沙 ( OC *sraːl, *sraːls ) > small.
Starting from some bronze inscriptions, the dots have become elongated. Based on this form, Shuowen erroneously considers it to be an ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 八 ( “ to divide; to separate ” ) + 丨 ( “ small object ” ) .
Compare with 少 ( OC *hmjewʔ, *hmjews ), represented by four dots in its oracle bone script form. Unrelated to the bottom part of 京 , 示 , 尞 , 尗 , and 原 .
