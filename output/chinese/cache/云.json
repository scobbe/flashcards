    "type": "pictogram; jiajie (rebus loan)",
    "description": "Pictogram: a stylized picture of clouds; later borrowed for “to say”. Original cloud sense distinguished as 雲 = semantic 雨 (“rain”) + phonetic 云.",
    "interpretation": "Initially a drawing of drifting clouds, the graph was later reused to write a near-homophone meaning “to say.” To separate the weather sense, scribes added the “rain” element to form 雲; modern simplified script reverted to the older form for “cloud.”",
    "simplification": "PRC simplification dropped the added semantic 雨 from 雲, returning to the older pictographic form 云 and unifying the shapes used for “cloud” and the loan sense “to say.”"
