    "description": "云(云) (yún, \"say\") + phonetic: 二(二) (èr) = cloud association; originally depicted the form of clouds",
    "interpretation": "The character 云(云) (yún, \"cloud\") combines 云(云) (yún, 'say') as a semantic element, originally meaning 'to say' or 'to speak,' but is used phonetically to represent a similar-sounding word for 'cloud.' The character was simplified from 雲(雲) to 云(云), retaining its phonetic and semantic components.",
    "simplification": "The traditional 雲(雲) was simplified by removing the radical 厶(厶) (sī, \"private\") and merging 冖(冖) (mì, \"cover\") with 二(二) (èr, \"two\") for a simpler form 云(云)."
