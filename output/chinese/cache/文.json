    "description": "Ideogram: a person with a tattooed chest (original form of 紋); the tattoo mark later disappeared, leaving a human outline; unrelated to 齐 and 攵.",
    "interpretation": "Depicts a human figure with a mark on the chest, evoking the idea of patterned markings. This sense broadened to ‘pattern,’ then to ‘script’ and ‘culture’ as culturally inscribed patterns. The chest mark was lost over time, which is why it now resembles 立 and contrasts with 大 (no chest).",
