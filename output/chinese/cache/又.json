    "description": "Pictogram – a right hand; original form of 右; unrelated to 𠬤 (> 译). Often written as 彐 in many modern characters (e.g., 事, 聿, 雪, 急, 爭, 尹, 建).",
    "interpretation": "Early graphs depict a right hand, which later gave rise to 右 ‘right (side)’. The adverbial sense ‘again’ developed later by semantic extension. In many compounds a similar shape is written as 彐, but that is a graphic convention rather than a direct historical component here.",
