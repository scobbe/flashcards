Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 戈 ( “ blade ” ) + 止 ( “ foot; to walk; to stop ” ) – army going on an expedition. In the character 武 , the 戈 component is written above the 止 component.
The graphical origin of 武 as “to stop violence” — the ultimate state of just warfare — is traditionally attributed to King Zhuang of Chu [597 BCE ] :
Linguistically, this was likely a misinterpretation, as 止 always means “to walk” ( 趾 ) when used as a radical, compare 步 ( bù ) , 歷 / 历 ( lì ) and 歧 ( qí ) .
