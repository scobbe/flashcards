A pictogram ( 象形 ) of a trident -like weapon or tool (note the oracle bone script form 𢦐 ). Jao & Zeng (1985, pp. 289–290) conjecture about its similarity to a kind of three-bladed polearm found at archaeological sites. Cf. 戈 (“polearm”), which is the same weapon but with a single blade instead of three. It was already borrowed for sound as an instance of jiajie ( 假借 ) for the pronoun 我 ( OC *ŋaːlʔ , “I”) since the oracle bone script.
Guo Moruo considers it to be the original character for 錡 ( OC *ɡral , “a kind of war axe with three blades or teeth”).
Folk etymology considers it to be an ideograph of a hand ( 手 ) holding a weapon ( 戈 ) to protect oneself .
