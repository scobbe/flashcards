The word "four" was written as 亖 ( sǐ ) before Western Zhou and 四 ( sì ) appeared in late Spring and Autumn period . This alternative form was used to prevent confusion of 亖 ( sǐ ) and 二 ( “ two ” ) or 三 ( “ three ” ) in vertical writing. It was standardized in Qin dynasty .
The bronzeware style of the character featured a repositioning of those four lines inside 口 ( kǒu ) ; this later evolved into the combination used today of 口 ( kǒu , “ mouth ” ) and 八 ( bā , “ divide ” ) which meant a dispersal of breath . It could thus be said that four is a borrowed meaning for this character. The original sense is preserved in 呬 ( OC *hrids ), by adding an extra 口 . Compare this character with 只 and 曰 .
