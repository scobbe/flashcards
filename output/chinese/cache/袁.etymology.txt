In oracle bone script, ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 衣 ( “ clothes ” ) + 又 ( “ hand ” ) – "to put on clothes; to wear", representing the original form of 擐 ( OC *ɡʷraːns ) ( Qiu, 1985 , Chi, 2014 ). Some variant forms added 〇 (the earliest form of 圓 ( OC *ɢon , “circle”), now written 口 ) as a sound component. The component 又 has corrupted into 㞢 in seal script and 土 in clerical script.
