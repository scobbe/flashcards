  "etymology": {
    "type": "simplified form (of a phono-semantic compound)",
    "description": "Simplified from 幚 (帛 → 巾), a variant of 幫; 幫 is phono-semantic: semantic 帛 “silk” + phonetic 封 (variant phonetic 邦).",
    "interpretation": "Original formation pointed to textiles (帛) with a phonetic element 封 to convey the sound, referring first to the upper part of a shoe (鞋幫). The later variant swapped the phonetic to 邦 and the simplified form replaced the more complex 帛 with 巾, preserving the idea of cloth while streamlining strokes.",
    "simplification": "Replaced 帛 with simpler 巾 and standardized the variant using 邦 as phonetic; officially adopted in the 1956 Character Simplification Scheme."
