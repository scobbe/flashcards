[夐]
Perhaps a cave or yurt (穴) with an eye in the middle (目) and, at the bottom of the character, a hand holding a stick similar to 支. The original form is attested in the Shuowen Jiezi. The bottom components (a stick in hand indicating authority and an eye) should convey the concept of "authority".
Perhaps linked to 奐 , in which it could appear as a contraction at the top of the character.

[敻]
variant form of 夐
