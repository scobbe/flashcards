    "type": "phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "舍: phonetic 余 + semantic 口 (余 originally wrote this word; 口 was later added to distinguish). 捨: semantic 扌 “hand” + phonetic 舍.",
    "interpretation": "In 舍, 余 provides the sound and once served as the original graph, with 口 later added as a semantic hint and to differentiate forms. When 扌 is added to form 捨, the hand radical marks a manual action of dropping or relinquishing while 舍 supplies the pronunciation, yielding the sense “to give up/abandon.”",
    "simplification": "Traditional 捨 was simplified to 舍 by dropping the hand radical 扌 and reusing the phonetic base; the verb sense merged into 舍 to reduce strokes and unify forms."
