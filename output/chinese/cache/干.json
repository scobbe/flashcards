    "type": "pictogram",
    "description": "Pictogram: a shield with feather ornaments; alternatively linked to a bifurcated weapon related to 單; later also used as a phonetic loan/simplification for 乾 and 幹.",
    "interpretation": "Originally depicted a plume-topped shield, though some oracle-bone forms may instead show a forked hunting weapon akin to 單. Through later phonetic borrowing it came to write both 乾 and 幹 in the simplified system, yielding multiple readings and senses today.",
    "simplification": "Mainland reforms merged 乾 and 幹 into 干 for graphic economy and phonetic loan use, so 干 now covers 'dry' (gān) and 'trunk; to do' (gàn); traditional Chinese keeps 乾 and 幹 distinct."
