[凡]
Pictogram ( 象形 ) – a plate, a flat dish. See also 風 and 同 . Unrelated to 几 .
Borrowed for abstract meanings. Another character 盤 ( OC *baːn ) was created to refer to the original word.
As an alternative, a bucket. If the character represents a bucket, part of its original meaning could be preserved in 同 and in turn in 筒 ( OC *doːŋ, *doːŋs , “bucket”).

[几]
Pictogram ( 象形 ) – a small stool viewed from the side. The original version was 𠀃, in which the horizontal stroke at the bottom represents the floor and/or the ground.
See also the bottom component of 其 , 真 , and 典 , in which 八 is the stylization of the legs of a table.
Unrelated to 鉛 , in which the top component is a stylization of 八 , representing stagnant water. Also unrelated to 朵 , 凡 , and 殳 .

[幾]
Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 𢆶 ( “ silk threads; little things ” ) + 戍 ( “ to guard against ” ) – watching over the fine details.
Note that the simplified form 几 ( OC *krilʔ , “small table”) is also a traditional character on its own.
