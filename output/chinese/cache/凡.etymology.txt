Pictogram ( 象形 ) – a plate, a flat dish. See also 風 and 同 . Unrelated to 几 .
Borrowed for abstract meanings. Another character 盤 ( OC *baːn ) was created to refer to the original word.
As an alternative, a bucket. If the character represents a bucket, part of its original meaning could be preserved in 同 and in turn in 筒 ( OC *doːŋ, *doːŋs , “bucket”).
