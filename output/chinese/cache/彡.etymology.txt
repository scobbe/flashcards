Pictogram ( 象形 ): three strands of hair. See also ⾽ , 而 , 冄 , and 㐱 .
However, in two characters, it indicates three light rays: in 昜 they represent sunrays while in 參 they represent the light rays of three stars.
The character today means "ornament", hence it is partly related to 丯 (incisions), 彭 (sound vibrations coming from a drum), and 影 (shadow). The three traits in 鬱 are simply decorative.
