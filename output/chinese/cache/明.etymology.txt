[明]
Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 日 ( “ sun ” ) + 月 ( “ moon ” ) – the sun just rising and the moon not yet set – dawn ( 天明 ( tiānmíng ) ). Alternatively, it may be interpreted as two bright celestial bodies – bright. This form was already found in the oracle bone script and was prevalent throughout the eras.
Three other forms were found in the oracle bone script:
• 朙 < 囧 ( “ window ” ) + 月 – the moon shining through a window – moonlight. This form was also prevalent in the ancient scripts and was considered to be the standard form in Shuowen . See this form's entry for its historical forms.
• 眀 ( míng ) < 目 ( “ eye ” ) + 月 – bright eyes. This form was rarely attested, so it is still uncertain whether this form is actually equivalent to 明 . It reappeared in the bamboo script of the Qin dynasty , but this was probably a corruption of 朙 .
• 𤰾 < 田 + 月 – probably a corruption of the above forms.
