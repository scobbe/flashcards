    "description": "艸(艸) (cǎo, \"grass\") as semantic + 盍(盍) (hé, \"why not\") as phonetic = thatch representing cover -> expanded to \"cover; lid; top\"",
    "interpretation": "The character 蓋(gài) originally depicted a thatch made from grass, used for covering structures. The phonetic component 盍(盍) (hé, \"why not\") was initially the original character for 'cover,' which later extended the semantic scope of 蓋(gài) as it was borrowed to also ask \"why not.\"",
    "simplification": "The traditional character 蓋 is simplified to 盖 by adopting a more streamlined form in mainland China."
