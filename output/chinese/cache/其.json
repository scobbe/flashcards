    "description": "𠀠 (basket pictogram) -> 丌 (stand) added under basket as phonetic and to enhance meaning -> borrowed for pronoun 'his' -> 箕(箕) (jī, 'basket') derived with additional 竹(竹) (zhú, 'bamboo')",
    "interpretation": "The character originally depicted a basket, symbolized by 𠀠, emphasizing its use. The addition of 丌 beneath the basket strengthened the meaning of a structural object or container, eventually leading to its phonetic borrowing to represent the pronoun 'his'. To reclaim the original meaning of a 'basket', 箕(箕) (jī, 'basket') was formed with an added bamboo radical.",
