Simplified from 𤐫 ( 火 → 示 and 𢍱 → 覀 ). Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): semantic 火 ( “ fire ” ) + semantic 𢍱 ( “ to rise high ” ) , which represents two pairs of hands holding and rising an object, perhaps a bag or basket ( 西 ). The character originally represented the idea of sparks rising up. By extension, it was also used to mean "token" or "label." [ 1 ] Then, the two pair of hands disappeared in the modern version.
Unrelated to the original version of 要 and 栗 .
