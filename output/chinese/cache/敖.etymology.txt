Originally 𫠤 , a pictogram ( 象形 ) depicting a person 人 with a headdress similar to 屮 and then 丰 and 出 (but unrelated to these character). Later, the person was stylized as a shape similar to 夭 (a young man walking vigorously); 攴 was added next to the pictogram perhaps to convey the concept of authority, making it a phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 ) and transforming it into 𢾍 ; the man under the headress then become stylized as 方 (or 万 in some fonts). See also 免 , 冒 , and 美 .
As an alternative, according to 季旭昇 Ji Xusheng, it represents a man walking and travelling in the countryside, symbolized by a sprout 屮 on top. See also the original form of 每 .
Shuowen Jiezi erroneously interprets it as an ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 出 ( “ leave ” ) + 放 ( “ release ” ) due to the later stylization.
