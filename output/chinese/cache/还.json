    "description": "semantic: 辵 (“walk”) + phonetic: 睘 (OC *ɡʷeŋ) – ‘to go back; to return’.",
    "interpretation": "The walking radical points to motion and the idea of going or coming back, while 睘 supplies the sound. Meanings later broadened in Mandarin to the adverbial senses ‘still/yet/also/fairly,’ though the historical core relates to returning movement.",
    "simplification": "Simplified by adopting the long-used abbreviated form 还 that omits the internal phonetic 睘, retaining 辶 and greatly reducing strokes."
