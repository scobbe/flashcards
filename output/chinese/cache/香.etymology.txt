In the oracle bone script, it was ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 黍 ( “ glutinous millet ” ) + 口 ( “ mouth ” ) . The whole character perhaps indicate that millet was used to produce liquor from fermentation which could be drank and/or sacrificed.
In the seal script, the 口 was replaced with the related 甘 (“sweet”). Hence, the most conservative variant is 𪏽 .
Currently, the 黍 has simplified into 禾 and the form of the bottom component 甘 has become akin to the unrelated 曰 .
