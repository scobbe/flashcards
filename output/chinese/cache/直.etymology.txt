Oracle bone script: Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 目 ( “ eye ” ) + 丨 ( “ vertical stroke ” ) – vertical stroke above the eye; looking straight ahead. Then, a black dot was drawn inside the vertical stroke and this point later became a horizontal stroke (hence getting a shape similar to 十 ).
The line on the side appears in bronze script and subsequently stretched under the 目 shape, while the traditional form appears in seal script.
A conservative version is used inside the character 𢛳 (> 德 ), while the modern version is used inside its variant 惪 . Unrelated to 具 and 真 .
