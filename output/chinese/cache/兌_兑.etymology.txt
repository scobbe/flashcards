[兌]
In the oracle bone script, it is a ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 八 ( “ speech; breath ” ) + 口 ( “ mouth ” ) + 人 ( “ person ” ) – speech; original character of 說 ( OC *hljod , “to speak”).
Alternatively, 八 may be interpreted as smile lines above the mouth (Gao Hongjin) or as meaning “to divide” (Lin Yiguang, i.e. the mouth is divided when smiling); in either case, the character would be the original character of 悅 ( OC *lod , “pleased”).
Shuowen interprets this character as a phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *l'oːds ): phonetic 㕣 ( OC *lon ) + semantic 儿 ( “ person ” ) .
