Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *dews, *djews ): phonetic 刀 ( OC *taːw ) + semantic 口 ( “ mouth ” ) – originally, to call out (with one’s mouth) or to serve wine for guests. Part of the second original meaning is preserved in 招 .
In the most ancient versions on some oracle bones, the character was totally different: it represented one or two hands over a wine vessel; the knife and mouth components were added later to this variant.
