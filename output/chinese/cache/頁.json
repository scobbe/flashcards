    "description": "首(首) (shǒu, \"head\") + 卩(卩) (jié, \"kneeling person\") = head of a kneeling person -> emphasis on \"head\" -> later used for \"page\"",
    "interpretation": "Originally depicting the head of a kneeling person, 頁(yè) was adapted to signify 'page' by association with leaves (葉). While its original sense of 'head' is retained in some radicals, its contemporary meaning as 'page' is more commonly recognized.",
    "simplification": "頁(頁) was simplified by adopting the cursive script version, resulting in 页(页). This process focused on reducing the complexity of the character while maintaining its phonetic resemblance."
