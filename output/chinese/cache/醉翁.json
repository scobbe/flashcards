    "interpretation": "醉翁(醉翁) (zuìwēng, \"drunken old man\") refers to someone who is intoxicated. The term originates from the phrase 醉翁之意不在酒 (zuì wēng zhī yì bù zài jiǔ), meaning \"the old man's intention was not just in the drinking,\" which comes from the Northern Song dynasty literati Ouyang Xiu's work \"醉翁亭记 (Drunken Old Man’s Pavilion).\" It suggests that there's often a deeper purpose or enjoyment beyond the apparent activity.",
