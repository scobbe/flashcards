[豊]
Originally an ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 壴 ( “ drum ” ) + 玨 ( “ strings of jade ” ) – ceremony. Original form of 禮 .
In some bronze inscriptions, 壴 has been split into two, with 豆 on the bottom. Later scripts, including the seal script, have inherited this corruption, leading Shuowen to interpret this character as a pictogram ( 象形 ) containing 豆 (“vessel”).
Due to similarity with the unrelated 豐 , 豊 has also been used as one of its variants.
