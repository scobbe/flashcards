The reduced form of the character 鬻 ( OC *luɡ ), which was an ideogrammic compound and the original character for "congee".

[鬻]
Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 䰜 ( “ cauldron ” ) + 米 ( “ rice ” ) — congee. Original form of 粥 ( OC *ʔljuɡ, *luɡ , “congee”).
䰜 is a variant form of 鬲 , which is a cauldron with three hollow legs, in which 米 (“rice”) is cooked. The two 弓 depict the steam emitted from the congee in the cauldron.
粥 (“congee”) is a reduced form of 鬻 . 鬻 has since been phonetically borrowed as jiajie ( 假借 ) to represent 𧶠 ( OC *luɡ , “to sell”).
