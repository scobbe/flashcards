    "description": "还(還) (hái, \"still; yet\") is a word indicating continuation or persistence in a state or action. 是(是) (shì, \"be\") is a copula, used to link the subject and predicate. The combination 还是(還是) means \"still\" or \"yet,\" suggesting the persistence of a state or situation despite expectations to the contrary.",
    "interpretation": "The word 还是(還是) (háishi, \"still; yet\") conveys the idea of something remaining unchanged or continuing in spite of circumstances that might suggest otherwise. It merges the concept of continuity from 还(還) (hái, \"still; yet\") with the confirming nature of 是(是) (shì, \"be\").",
