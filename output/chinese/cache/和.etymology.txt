Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *ɡoːl, *ɡoːls ): phonetic 禾 ( OC *ɡoːl ) + semantic 口 ( “ mouth ” ) – harmony. The original version was 龢 , with the radical of the flute 𠎤 (> 龠 ) in its either archaic or contracted version perhaps to indicate the abstract concept of harmony through harmony in music.
