  "etymology": {
    "type": "phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "semantic: 夊 (‘slow step’) + phonetic: 來; 來 was originally used for ‘wheat’.",
    "interpretation": "Meaning is anchored by a ‘slow step/footprint’ semantic hint that evokes reaping or drooping stalks, while 來 supplies the sound. In early usage, 來 itself denoted ‘wheat’, which explains the tight semantic link that later specialized into 麥/麦.",
    "simplification": "Simplified from 麥 by streamlining the phonetic 來 and altering its 八 component to a single horizontal stroke (per Wiktionary), reducing strokes and compressing the original phono-semantic layout into 麦."
