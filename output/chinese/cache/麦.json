  "etymology": {
    "type": "phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "來(來) (lái, \"come\") + 夊(夊) (suī, \"footprint pointing down\") -> Phonetic for wheat and symbolic of wheat's growth -> 麥(麥) (mài, \"wheat\")",
    "interpretation": "The character 麥(麥) (mài, \"wheat\") uses 來(來) (lái, \"come\") as its phonetic component, emphasizing phonetic similarity when the original meaning 'wheat' was borrowed for 'to come'. The component 夊(夊) (suī, \"footprint pointing down\") suggests wheat's growth. This compound helped differentiate 麥(麥) from 來(來), as the latter came to be used primarily for 'to come'.",
    "simplification": "The traditional character 麥(麥) was simplified by changing 八(八) (bā, \"eight\") to a horizontal line, leading to 麦(麥). This simplification reflects a common approach to ease of writing."
