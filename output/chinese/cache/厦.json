    "description": "semantic 广 + phonetic 夏 (phonetic also conveys 'great').",
    "interpretation": "广 depicts a building/shelter, signaling the idea of a structure. 夏 supplies the sound xià, and since it can also mean “great,” it reinforces the sense of a large, imposing building such as a mansion.",
    "simplification": "In Simplified Chinese, the shelter component 广 was regularized to 厂 and the structure compressed, reducing strokes while retaining the phonetic 夏."
