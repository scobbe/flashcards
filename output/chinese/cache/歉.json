    "interpretation": "The character 歉(歉) (qiàn, \"apology; regret\") combines 兼(兼) (jiān, \"hold together, combine\"), which may reference food in its depiction of a hand holding two crop plants, with 欠(欠) (qiàn, \"person with mouth open\"), suggesting the act of wanting or needing more, originally relating to hunger. This connection to unsatisfied needs or desires extends to the modern sense of apology or regret for an unmet duty or expectation.",
