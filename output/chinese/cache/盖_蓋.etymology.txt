[盖]
Found in the Zhengzitong 《 正字通 ( Zhèngzìtōng ) 》 as an unorthodox variant ( 俗字 ) of 蓋 . Currently used as the form adopted in mainland China.

[蓋]
Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *kaːbs, *kaːb, *ɡaːb ): semantic 艸 ( “ grass ” ) + phonetic 盍 ( OC *ɡaːb ) — a thatch.
盍 is the original character for the “cover” sense. However, because this original character was borrowed to mean “why not”, the scope of senses for 蓋 expanded to include the “cover” sense (and its extended meanings).
