[會]
Pictogram ( 象形 ). The upper part and the lower part of the character, on the basis of the original versions, can be unified into 合 (two open mouths) with a food container in the middle; this character means both "bring together" (e.g., bring together people to discuss, putting a lid on a vessel) and "close, shut". The top of the character resembles 食 , but it's connected to another mouth at the bottom of the character. The food container could be a 膾 / 脍 ( kuài ) , an ancient container for raw fish and finely minced/chopped meat.

[曾]
Pictogram ( 象形 ) – a cooker for steaming food. The derivative 甑 ( OC *ʔsɯŋs ) refers to the original word. Later jiajie ( 假借 ) for 曾 ( OC *ʔsɯːŋ, *zɯːŋ , “once already”).
In the bronze inscriptions, a decorative 口 was added, which further evolved into 曰 .

[曽] variant form of 曾.
