Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *ɡron, *kronʔ, *krons, *ɡonʔ ): phonetic 𢍏 ( juàn ) + semantic 卩 ( “ kneeling person ” ) - to bend; reel of books. The phonetic component could also add part of the meaning since it indicates the act of rolling rice into balls, hence "bending" rice. Two rather conservative variants are 𨤖 and 𠨟 , in which rice is visible on top.
Now written as phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 ): phonetic 龹 + semantic 卩 ( “ kneeling person ” ) . Similar but unrelated to 春 and 秦 .
