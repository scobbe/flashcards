Pictogram ( 象形 ) of a ritual axe made perhaps of jade, symbols of the king's power. A ceremonial axe was kept near the throne, and was used for performing rituals in ancient China.
The traditional interpretation (most likely a folk etymology given the original appearance of the character) is that the character metaphorically indicates the king or emperor according to the ancient Chinese thought: three horizontal strokes represent Heaven, Man and Earth, and the vertical stroke is the king or emperor, the one who connects them together. However, compare 天 ( tiān ) (a man with a horizontal stroke above his head to indicate the sky).
Unrelated to 玉 ( yù , “ a string with three pieces of jade ” ) and 主 ( “ master ” ) ; partly related to 士 (a war axe and, perhaps, sometimes a variant of 王), to 戉 (an axe drawn vertically), to the inner component of 匡 ( kuāng , “ square‑shaped bamboo basket ” ) , and to the right component of 往 (< 𢓸 ).
