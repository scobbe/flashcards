[將]
Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *ʔsaŋ, *ʔsaŋs ): phonetic 爿 ( OC *braːn, *zaŋ , “ bed; small table ” ) + semantic ⺼ ( “ meat ” ) + semantic 寸 ( “ hand ” ) – to offer meat as tribute. Besides pronunciation, 爿 may partly indicate a small cutting board and/or sacrificial table on which the meat is placed. The sacrificial meat and the hand together form the shape 𪧷 , which is similar but unrelated to 有 .
The ⺼ component is on its side, hence resembles 夕 with an added dot; compare 祭 , 然 .
Shuowen erroneously considers the phonetic component of 將 to be 醬 ( OC *ʔsaŋs , “sauce”) (abbreviated).
