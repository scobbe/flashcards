    "type": "ideogram (指事), differentiated form (分化字)",
    "description": "Differentiated form of 高 (“high, tall”), marked with an added element—variously a stroke, 屮, 止, 力, 九, or 夭; later Shuowen misread the 夭 form and treated it as phono-semantic.",
    "interpretation": "Originally a marked variant of 高 used to indicate the idea of height/loftiness while distinguishing it graphically with small markers. The 夭-shaped variant became standard in later scripts, which led some scholars to mistakenly analyze 夭 as a semantic component and reclassify it.",
    "simplification": "Simplified to 乔 by generalizing the later 夭-based outline and removing the complex 高 framework, reducing strokes and regularizing the shape in the PRC simplification scheme."
