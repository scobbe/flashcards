    "description": "semantic: 囗 ‘walled city’ + 啚 (early form of 鄙, ‘remote areas/territory’); simplified 啚 → 冬.",
    "interpretation": "An enclosure 囗 surrounds 啚, evoking a bounded territory, which extends to the sense of a map, picture, or plan of an area. In simplification, 啚 was replaced by the simpler 冬 to cut strokes while preserving the enclosed-area silhouette and meaning.",
    "simplification": "啚 was replaced with the graphically simpler 冬 to reduce stroke count and ease writing; the change is shape-based rather than phonetic."
