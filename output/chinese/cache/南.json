    "type": "pictogram",
    "description": "Pictogram: a hanging percussion instrument (bell), originally identical to the left side of 㱿; later phonetically borrowed to represent “south”.",
    "interpretation": "Earliest forms depict a hanging bell-like instrument, and because its sound matched the word for ‘south’ in Old Chinese, the graph was borrowed for that meaning, displacing the original sense. Another proposal reads it as the front of a south-facing house, mirroring traditional architectural orientation.",
