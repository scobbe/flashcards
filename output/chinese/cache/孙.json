    "description": "Simplified from the traditional character 孫 where 系 is simplified to 小.",
    "interpretation": "The traditional character 孫 consists of two parts: 子 (zǐ, son) and 系 (xì, continue), forming an ideogrammic compound that suggests lineage or continuation through descendants. In the simplified character 孙, the component 系 has been replaced with 小 (xiǎo, small), reducing the number of strokes and simplifying the character.",
