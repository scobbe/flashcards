[尞]
Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ).
The earliest oracle bone inscriptions show 木 (“tree”) with dots around it representing flames – sacrifice with firewood. In some oracle bone inscriptions, 火 (“fire”) was added to emphasize the fire used in the sacrifice.
In the bronze inscriptions, 呂 ( OC *ɡ·raʔ ) was often added as a phonetic component, as seen in 寮 ( OC *reːw ) and 潦 ( OC *reːwʔ, *reːws ). This component may have been the basis of the 日 component found in late bronze inscriptions and in the seal script.
Shuowen interprets the character as 眘 ( “ serious ” ) + 火 ( “ fire ” ) .

[僚]
