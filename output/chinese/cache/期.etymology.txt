Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *kɯ, *ɡɯ ): phonetic 其 ( OC *kɯ, *ɡɯ ) + semantic 月 ( “ moon ” ) – changing moon marks the passage of time, hence a period of time. In the original version, there was a sun 日 instead of the moon, hence the original version is 㫷 (with variant 𣇳). Then, the character became 朞 .
