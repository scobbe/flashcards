  "etymology": {
    "type": "phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "semantic 广 + phonetic 敞",
    "interpretation": "Combines 广, originally a cliff/eaves element meaning a building or shelter, with 敞 as the phonetic chǎng ‘spacious, open’. The industrial sense ‘factory’ arises from a large, open work building, with 敞 supplying the pronunciation.",
    "simplification": "廠 was simplified to 厂 by dropping the phonetic 敞 and retaining only the abbreviated semantic shelter/cliff element; this follows a common reform pattern of removing phonetics for high-frequency characters and coincides with an existing simple graph 厂, while keeping the reading chǎng."
