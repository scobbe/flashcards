Probably phono-semantic ( 形聲 / 形声 ) following the pronunciation of 方 ( OC *paŋ, *baŋ ).
The upper component, which perhaps indicates the semantic field, is unclear and has evolved significantly in time, including 冖 ( Shang ), 凡 ( Western Zhou ), or forms resembling 辛 ( Spring and Autumn bronze of Wu ) or 用 ( Warring States bronze inscription of Wei and proto- clerical script of Qin ). In the Chu Silk Manuscript the form was much simplified.
The modern form was a descendant from the clerical script. Hence, a knife or chisel to mark prisoners 辛 is written above the phonetic component 方, perhaps to indicate the concept of moving to remote. However, as already stated, the semantic component in this character is unclear and evolved during time, hence more explanations linked to the earlier versions can be formulated.
