  "etymology": {
    "type": "phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "semantic: 一(一) (yī, \"one\") + phonetic: 官(官) (guān, \"official\") -> two units of the same kind",
    "interpretation": "The character 两(兩) (liǎng, \"two\") combines 一(一) (yī, \"one\") to signify singular quantity, with 官(官) (guān, \"official\") denoting two of a kind, suggesting a pair or a couple of official units. This reflects its usage to count or refer to two items, particularly in contexts like weight (as in the traditional Chinese ounce or 'liang').",
    "simplification": "Traditional character 兩(兩) was simplified by reducing the complexity of components like 官(官) to a more cursive form without changing the fundamental elements, thus retaining semantic and phonetic associations."
