    "description": "semantic: 衣 ‘clothes’ + 又 ‘hand’; variants added 〇 (now 口) as a phonetic from 圓; 又 later altered to 㞢/土 in later scripts. Originally depicted ‘to put on clothes; to wear’ (original form of 擐).",
    "interpretation": "Portrays a hand putting on clothing, expressing the act of wearing; this image underlies its early use as the form later written 擐. Over time, scribal changes reshaped 又 into forms like 㞢/土, and some variants borrowed 口 from 圓 as a phonetic cue, which aligns with the Yuán reading.",
