[算]
In current form, 竹 ( “ bamboo ” ) + 目 + 廾 .
The 目 portion may have originally represented counting rods (or possibly an abacus , although the character is believed to predate its invention). Such rods were typically made from bamboo. Perhaps related to the top component of 學 , hence to 爻 .
Similar but unrelated to 具 .
