    "description": "semantic: 木 (\"tree, wood\") + phonetic: 昜; simplified from 楊 (昜 → 𠃓).",
    "interpretation": "Combines the wood element with the phonetic yáng (昜) to signal a tree whose name is pronounced yáng. In simplification, the phonetic was reduced to 𠃓 while keeping 木, preserving both meaning and sound with fewer strokes.",
    "simplification": "Replaced the phonetic 昜 with the abbreviated component 𠃓 to reduce strokes and match the series seen in 阳, while retaining the semantic 木."
