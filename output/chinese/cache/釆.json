    "interpretation": "One tradition sees a splayed paw, evoking the idea of spreading apart and thus distinguishing. Another reads the graph as a plough scattering seeds, which also suggests spreading and differentiation. Similarity to the component atop 𢍏/奧 is accidental and historically unrelated.",
