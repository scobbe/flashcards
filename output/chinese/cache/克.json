  "simplified": "克",

  "etymology": {
    "type": "ideogrammic compound (會意); alternatively pictogram (象形)",
    "description": "會意: 由 (battle helmet) + 皮 (pelt) → ‘to defeat/vanquish’; alternatively 象形: 卩 (person) carrying 由 (a load) → ‘to shoulder/be competent’.",
    "interpretation": "One analysis sees a helmet and a pelt evoking triumph in combat, hence senses like overcoming or subduing. Another views a person bearing a load, extending to being able, managing, or having capacity. Later usages broadened to restraint and the metric unit reading.",
    "simplification": "Traditional 剋 was simplified by dropping the right-side 刂, merging into the long-used form 克 to reduce strokes while keeping pronunciation and core senses."
