[巳]
Two different theories:
• Pictogram ( 象形 ) of a fetus (it can be seen in 包 , 胞 . In 包, the radical should represent the placenta. 胞 today means "cell").
• Pictogram ( 象形 ) of a snake (therefore, it should be similar to 巴 ). This theory is found in the Shuowen Jiezi, which however is not based on oracle bones versions of characters.
The character is similar to 已 , which cannot be found in the Shuowen Jiezi.

[已]
May have originally been the same character as 巳 , a pictogram ( 象形 ) of either a snake or a fetus. This character cannot be found in the Shuowen Jiezi .

[己]
Pictogram ( 象形 ) – silk rope for binding objects. Original form of 紀 ( OC *kɯʔ ). The character must not be confused with 已 and 巳 . See also 丩 .
