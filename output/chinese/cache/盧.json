  "etymology": {
    "type": "phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "Originally a pictogram (oven); later a phono-semantic compound: phonetic 虍 + semantic 田 (pictogram of an oven) + semantic 皿 (vessel).",
    "interpretation": "An early drawing of an oven evolved into a compound where 虍 suggests the sound, while 田 (the oven pictogram) and 皿 (a vessel) supply the meaning of a cooking/heating container. The ‘oven’ sense was later specialized into 爐/炉, while 盧 continued in names and other uses.",
    "simplification": "盧 was simplified to 卢 by adopting a long-used handwritten/clerical variant, streamlining the complex 虍 + 田 + 皿 structure while preserving the pronunciation."
