    "description": "会意: 网 ‘net’ + 維 ‘bird (tied with string)’ — net for catching birds; simplified 維→夕.",
    "interpretation": "A net combined with a bound bird depicts a trap for snaring birds, which extended to the senses ‘net’ and ‘to catch’. In simplification, the complex 維 was reduced to 夕 to cut strokes while preserving the net element that conveys the core meaning.",
    "simplification": "Replaced the complex 維 with simple 夕 to reduce strokes and improve writeability, while keeping 网 to preserve the ‘net’ meaning."
