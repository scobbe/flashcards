Pictogram ( 象形 ). A cereal 禾 with water 水 or kernels under it. The water may symbolize the wine made from millet or the fact that millet is sticky and water-resistant; otherwise, given that millet is a resistant plant that can grow on dry ground, the "water" component remains unexplained. See 黎 , in which the radical appears as a contracted form.
