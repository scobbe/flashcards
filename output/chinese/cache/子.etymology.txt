Pictogram ( 象形 ) – an image of a baby, with a large head and spread arms. The legs are wrapped in a blanket. Compare with 了 , where the arms are wrapped, and 㜽 , in which a lock of hair is visible on top. Compare also 棄 and 毓 , in which the image of the baby is reversed upside-down.
The big seal script form is much more elaborate, showing a baby with hair on a head ( 囟 ) and arms on the two sides of the body, sitting on a stool ( 几 ).
