    "interpretation": "Initially a pictogram illustrating two disconnected metal blocks, the character 呂(呂) (lǚ, 'two blocks of metal') was later adapted by connecting the blocks, becoming stylized as it was repurposed for various meanings including 'spine' and 'music notes'.",
    "simplification": "呂(呂) was adapted into 呂(吕) as a simplified form without altering the meaning, simplifying the lines to produce a more cursive appearance."
