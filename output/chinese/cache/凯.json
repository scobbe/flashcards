    "description": "semantic: 豆 (dòu, bean) + phonetic: 凡 (fán, ordinary)",
    "interpretation": "凯 (kǎi) represents a concept of triumph or victory, derived from its original association with victory music. The semantic component is 豆 (dòu, bean), which may relate to beans being used in celebratory and ritual contexts, while the phonetic element 凡 (fán), adds the sound value. Over time, the semantic association of 豆 has diminished, emphasizing the victorious connotation.",
    "simplification": "The character 凯 simplifies 凱 by replacing 豆 with 己 (jǐ), as they have similar structures and 己 is visually simpler."
