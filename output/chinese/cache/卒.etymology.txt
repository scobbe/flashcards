[卒]
There were 5 forms of 卒 in Shang oracle bone script ( Qiu, 1990 ; Xuan, 2012 ):
The brush shape in form (5) was often placed upside down. Later the inverted brush shape was mistaken as 又 and then moved to the top as in Chu slip and silk script ( 𰠄 ) to avoid obscuration with 袁 ( 衣 + 又 ) ( Xuan, 2012 ).

[卆]
Unorthodox variant of 卒 . Compare 雑 from 雜 .
