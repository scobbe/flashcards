[了]
According to the Shuowen Jiezi , a pictogram ( 象形 ) of a baby without arms. Compare with 子 , where the arms are visible. The Shuowen defines 了 as "the crossing of lower legs".
In the Shuowen Jiezi Zhu , a commentary to the Shuowen Jiezi, it is said that the pictogram instead depicts entangled legs ( 了戾 ).
Its relation with the meaning "to finish" is likely via sound loan, but an argument can be made about "entangled legs" → "tie"→ "finish".
Unrelated to 亨 .

[尞]
Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ).
The earliest oracle bone inscriptions show 木 (“tree”) with dots around it representing flames – sacrifice with firewood. In some oracle bone inscriptions, 火 (“fire”) was added to emphasize the fire used in the sacrifice.
In the bronze inscriptions, 呂 ( OC *ɡ·raʔ ) was often added as a phonetic component, as seen in 寮 ( OC *reːw ) and 潦 ( OC *reːwʔ, *reːws ). This component may have been the basis of the 日 component found in late bronze inscriptions and in the seal script.
Shuowen interprets the character as 眘 ( “ serious ” ) + 火 ( “ fire ” ) .

[僚]
Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *rewʔ, *reːw ): semantic 人 ( “ person ” ) + phonetic 尞 .
