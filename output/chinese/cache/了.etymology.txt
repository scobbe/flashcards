According to the Shuowen Jiezi , a pictogram ( 象形 ) of a baby without arms. Compare with 子 , where the arms are visible. The Shuowen defines 了 as "the crossing of lower legs".
In the Shuowen Jiezi Zhu , a commentary to the Shuowen Jiezi, it is said that the pictogram instead depicts entangled legs ( 了戾 ).
Its relation with the meaning "to finish" is likely via sound loan, but an argument can be made about "entangled legs" → "tie"→ "finish".
Unrelated to 亨 .
