    "type": "pictogram",
    "description": "Pictogram: a luxuriant plant growing on the ground (土); the bottom stroke is missing in the modern form.",
    "interpretation": "Originally depicted a lush plant sprouting from the soil, naturally extending to the idea of abundance and fullness. Over time the base stroke for “ground” was lost, leaving a streamlined shape that still suggests upright, thriving growth.",
    "simplification": "Mainland reform replaced 豐 with the older pictographic form 丰, dropping the 豆 ‘vessel’ component and reverting to a simpler ancient glyph to reduce strokes."
