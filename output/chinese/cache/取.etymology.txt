Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 耳 ( “ ear ” ) + 又 ( “ hand ” ) - to take the ear of fallen prey, a rite of hunters mentioned in the Rites of Zhou.
Shuowen interprets it as taking the ear of an enemy instead. However, Wang (2022) points out that there is no evidence that this actually happened in war. [ 1 ]
