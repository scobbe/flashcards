[卯]
The character represents a pair of knives to butcher animals. The original meaning is preserved in 劉 ( OC *m·ru ). An old and conservative variant is 戼 .
This character was found in oracle bone scripts depicting a sacrifice (a human or animal body) that is cut in half. This kind of practice mainly happened in Shang dynasty and was gradually eliminated after Zhou 's conquest of Shang, leading to obscurity of the character's original meaning.
According to Shuowen Jiezi, it is an open door, like 門 ／ 𨳇 ( mén ) but reversed; however, Xu Shen's interpretations are not based on oracle bones and bronzes. Another similar folk etymology links the character to the mortise in woodworking .
