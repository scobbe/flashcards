Original meaning unknown. In oracle bone inscriptions, phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *qoŋ ): phonetic 吕 ( OC *kuŋ ) + semantic 隹 ( “ bird ” ) . The phonetic component is not 吕 ( OC *ɡ·raʔ ), but ancient form of 宮 ( OC *kuŋ ). Some variants also contained 水 . In the Warring States period the 吕 below 水 had corrupted into 邑 , making 邕 ( OC *qoŋ ) the new phonetic component.
