[攵]
variant form of 攴

[攴]
Pictogram ( 象形 ): a hand ( 又 ) holding a tool of some sort (possibly a weapon or whip), meaning “to hit”. The tool later corrupted into the phonetic component 卜 ( OC *poːɡ ). Today, the character is mostly stylized except in some archaic variants.
Similar but unrelated to 支 , 伊 , and 父 . The stylized version is unrelated to 囱 ( OC *sʰroːŋ, *sʰloːŋ ) (> 窗 ) and 文 .

[支]
Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 又 ( “ hand ” ) + 十 ( “ (half of 竹 ) branch of bamboo ” ) – a branch.
Similar but unrelated to 攴 , 丈 , 尹 and 父 .

[丈]
Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 十 ( “ ten ” ) + 又 ( “ hand ” ) – ten chi ( 尺 ) is one zhang ( 丈 ). Similar but unrelated to 支 .
