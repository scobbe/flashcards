[央]
Unclear. Possibly a pictogram ( 象形 ) of a man with the neck in shackles — original form of 殃 ( OC *qaŋ , “misfortune”). [ 1 ] Later borrowed to represent 央 ( OC *qaŋ , “center”) as an instance of jiajie ( 假借 ).
Shuowen interprets it as a person inside a house.

[中]
Pictogram ( 象形 ) – a flagpole, as depicted in its original form 𠁩 . Based on archaeological evidence, the middle box has been interpreted as a drum ( 建鼓 ). This flagpole with a drum was placed in the center of a field to gather people and to detect the direction of the wind. In addition, the pronunciation of 中 ( OC *tuŋ, *tuŋs ) is reminiscent of the beating of a drum.
Shuowen interprets the character as a vertical stroke 丨 passing through the center of 口 , indicating the center.
It has also been interpreted as an arrow in the center of a target.
