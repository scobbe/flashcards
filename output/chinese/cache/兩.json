    "description": "Depicts a balanced pair of objects or a scale -> used to represent 'two' or 'both sides' -> evolved to have the cursive form 魎(魎) (liǎng, 'mythical demon') for etymological distinction",
    "interpretation": "兩(兩) (liǎng, 'two') visually represents a sense of balance and symmetry, akin to scales. It shows two symmetrical halves, which directly conveys the meaning of 'two'. Despite its connection to 魎(魎) (liǎng, 'mythical demon'), its common use pertains to counting and refers to duality or partnership. Over time, 魎 became primarily associated with a specific mythical connotation, whereas 兩 retained the general numerative sense.",
    "simplification": "The character 兩(兩) (liǎng, 'two') does not have a simplified form distinct from its traditional form."
