  "simplified": "动",
  "traditional": "動",
  "pinyin": "dòng",
  "english": "to move; movement; to stir/touch; to set in motion",
  "etymology": {
    "type": "phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "semantic: 力 (“strength”) + phonetic: 重; simplified from 動 (重 → 云).",
    "interpretation": "Combines the idea of strength (力) with the heavy/weighty phonetic 重, evoking exerting force to move something substantial. In simplification, 重 was reduced to 云 for ease of writing, while the semantic cue 力 still signals physical action and the phonetic link became less transparent.",
    "simplification": "重 was replaced by 云 to reduce stroke count and regularize the component across several simplified forms; semantics via 力 were preserved but the phonetic cue weakened."
