Pictogram ( 象形 ). Possible interpretations:
• The sepal of a flower; original form of 蒂 ( OC *teːds , “stem; peduncle”).
• Tied-up firewood perhaps used as a sacrifice; original form of 禘 ( OC *deːɡs ).
• An altar; original form of 禘 ( OC *deːɡs ).
• An asterism joining three stars of Ursa Major with three of Ursa Minor , together with Thuban and Kochab . Around 2000 BCE the three top-to-bottom lines would have crossed at the north celestial pole, where the god 帝 dwelt ( Pankenier, 2004 ).
The character's first attested use is for “God of Heaven”; it was later used as a title for emperors. Shuowen erroneously interprets the character to be a phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *teːɡs ): semantic 丄 ( “ up; above ” ) + phonetic 朿 ( OC *sʰeɡs ) .
