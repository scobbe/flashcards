    "type": "pictogram",
    "description": "Pictogram: two bent lines indicating “to divide”; later borrowed to mean “eight” via homophony (original sense now in 分, 別).",
    "interpretation": "Depicts two strokes diverging to suggest splitting or separation. Later became a rebus for the number eight because it shared the same sound, while the original sense lived on in 分 and 別. Not the “two hands” component found in other characters.",
