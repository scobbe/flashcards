    "description": "From 畵 with 𦘒 omitted; phono-semantic: semantic 聿 (brush) + phonetic 規.",
    "interpretation": "Built from the idea of a writing brush (聿) combined with the sound-providing element 規, conveying the act of making lines or drawings. The simplified form 画 streamlines the earlier 畫 while retaining the core notion of marking or delineating.",
