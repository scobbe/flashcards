    "interpretation": "The character 畫(畫) originally depicted the idea of making lines or designs using a brush, reflecting the semantic 聿(聿) (yù, \"brush\") aspect. The additional component 規(規) (guī, \"compass\") serves as a phonetic element and reinforces the notion of creating bounded or regulated art forms.",
    "simplification": "The simplified character 画 omits 𦘒 from the original 畵, retaining the central semantic of brushwork while streamlining the complexity."
