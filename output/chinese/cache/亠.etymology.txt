• in 立 and 交 it represents the head and open arms of a human
• in 六 it represents the roof of a hut
• in 衣 it represents the top of a traditional cloth
• in 玄 it represents a mark over two interwoven silk threads
• in 辛 it represents the top of a knife or chisel to mark prisoners
• in 离 it represents grass

[宀]
Pictogram ( 象形 ) – a house; similar to 广 . According to Wang Yun (王筠), the latter character depicts a building with three walls, while the former depicts a house with four walls.
Today, the pictogram appears smaller, but a conservative character is 𰃦 , which appears in 向 . See also the top component of 冡 and the original version of 叟 .

[冖]
A cloth used to cover something. Unrelated to 写 (< 寫 ), 愛 , 亭 , 亮 , 高 , and 學 .

[冪]
Originally written as 幎 : Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *meːɡ ): semantic 巾 ( “ cloth ” ) + phonetic 冥 ( OC *meːŋ ) ; Xu Shen indicates that the character 幎 means "幔", "tent" (today written as 帷幕).
Later the 六 was corrupted to 大 and the radical was written under the character, thus it became 幂 .
艹 was added to form a new phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *meːɡ ): semantic 巾 ( “ cloth ” ) + phonetic 幕 ( OC *maːɡ ) .

[幂]
See 冪 ／ 幂 ( mì ).
