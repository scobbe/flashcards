    "description": "Simplified from 頭: 豆 (phonetic) → ⺀; 頁/页 (semantic “head”) → 大. Traditional 頭 is phono-semantic: semantic 頁 + phonetic 豆.",
    "interpretation": "A cursive abbreviation of 頭 where the original phonetic 豆 was reduced to a dot-like stroke and the semantic 頁/页 was streamlined to 大. The simplification preserves overall silhouette while dropping the original phonetic-semantic clarity.",
    "simplification": "Cursive-derived stroke reduction to ease writing: 豆 → ⺀ and 頁/页 → 大; merges and streamlines parts of 頭."
