[丌]
an ancient form of 其

[其]
In the oracle bone script, it was originally 𠀠 , a pictogram ( 象形 ) of a basket .
In the bronze inscriptions, 丌 was added under the basket to represent a stand . It may also have acted as a phonetic component. Hence, the modified version was 𠔝. See also the bottom component of 眞 .
Later borrowed for an Old Chinese pronoun. The derivative 箕 ( OC *kɯ ) refers to the original word.
