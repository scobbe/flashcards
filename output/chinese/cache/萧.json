    "description": "semantic: 艹 ‘grass’ + phonetic: 肖; in trad 蕭: semantic: 艹 + phonetic: 肅.",
    "interpretation": "Grass radical marks a plant, while 肖/肅 supplies the sound xiāo. The core sense refers to a kind of herb (mugwort), and from poetic usage it extends to bleak or desolate atmospheres, as in set phrases like 萧瑟 and 萧条.",
    "simplification": "The complex phonetic 肅 in 蕭 was replaced by the simpler, closer-sounding 肖, reducing strokes and regularizing the phonetic cue (cf. 箫 < 簫)."
