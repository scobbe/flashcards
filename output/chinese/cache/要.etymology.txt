[要]
Pictogram ( 象形 ): a man 大 then drawn as a woman ( 女 ) with two hands pointing to his/her midsection. On top of the character there was huge eye 目, then stylized as a horn 角. The hands gradually shifted upwards; hence, a nearly-original version of the character is 𡢗 . All the upper part was eventually stylized as 覀 . Unrelated to 栗 but partly related to 票 .
Original meaning was “waist” (now 腰 ( OC *qew )).

[贾]
Simplified from 賈 ( 貝 → 贝 )

[賈]
Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *kraːʔ, *kraːs, *klaːʔ ): phonetic 襾 ( OC *qraːs ) + semantic 貝 ( “ shellfish ” ) .
