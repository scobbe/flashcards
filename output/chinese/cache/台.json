    "description": "semantic: 厶(厶) (sī, \"private\") + phonetic: 旦(旦) (dàn, \"dawn\") = originally platform or raised structure for viewing -> platform",
    "interpretation": "The character 台(臺) (tái, \"platform\") combines 厶(厶) (sī, \"private\") as a semantic indicator that suggests an enclosed or elevated space, with 旦(旦) (dàn, \"dawn\") serving as the phonetic element. This reflects its original meaning of a raised structure or stage, which is conceptually linked to a centralized or focal point that commands attention, much like a platform does.",
    "simplification": "台(臺): Simplified by omitting the top element in 臺 and standardizing the form as it sounds and functions similarly to its traditional counterpart."
