Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 夊 + 𡕒 (second character roughly ヰ ) – two feet facing in the same direction. Compare ⽨ , with feet in different directions (and hence divergent); compare 夅 , with feet pointing down; compare feet in 步 . Compare also footprint in 夂 , 夊 , 𡕒 , and 韋 .
Note that the left foot has changed shape rather more than the right foot, which still resembles the form in earlier script.
