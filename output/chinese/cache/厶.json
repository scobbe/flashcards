    "interpretation": "The character 厶(sī, 'private') visually represents the concept of 'revolving around oneself,' symbolizing the inward-focused nature of privacy and self-interest. It originally denoted the idea of 'private' by itself and is compared to 公(gōng, 'public'). It later became part of the character 私(私) (sī, 'selfish; private'), where 禾(禾) (hé, 'grain') was added for the semantic aspect.",
