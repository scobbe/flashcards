    "type": "compound word",
    "description": "The word 马上(馬上) (mǎshàng, \"right away; immediately\") combines 马(馬) (mǎ, \"horse\") and 上(上) (shàng, \"on top; upward\"). Historically, this term conveyed the sense of being mounted on a horse, ready to depart swiftly and promptly. When one was on horseback, they could move without delay, which has evolved into the figurative meaning of doing something \"right away\" or \"immediately.\"",
