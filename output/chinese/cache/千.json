    "description": "一(一) (yī, \"one\") as semantic component indicating a number + 人(人) (rén, \"person\") as phonetic component -> sounds similar to 人(人) -> thousand as an extension in counting",
    "interpretation": "The character 千(qiān) takes its semantic aspect from 一(一) to signify a number, while 人(人) provides phonetic guidance due to its similar ancient pronunciation. The idea of reaching 'one thousand' involves an extension or continuation in counting, which is conceptually represented by the additional line.",
