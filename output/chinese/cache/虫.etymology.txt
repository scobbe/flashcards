Pictogram ( 象形 ): a snake.
The character originally represented a type of venomous snake, while the derivative 蟲 / 虫 represented worms and insects (or insect-like things). 虫 was later borrowed for 蟲 / 虫 (possibly via simplification), and the character 虺 was created to represent the original meaning.
