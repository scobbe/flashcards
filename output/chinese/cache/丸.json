    "interpretation": "Originally the same graph as 夗, it was later distinguished to denote a small round object or pellet. The Shuowen view treats it as derived from a flipped 仄, evoking something that tilts or rolls, hence roundness. It is not etymologically related to the 丮-based component seen in 執 and 孰.",
