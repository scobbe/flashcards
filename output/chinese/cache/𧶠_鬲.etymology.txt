[𧶠]
Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *luɡ ): phonetic 𡍬 ( OC *mluɡ ) + semantic 貝 ; the original version is 𧸇 . 𡍬 was further reduced to 士 and 四 to give its present form, which is often confused with the graphically (and semantically) similar but etymologically unrelated 賣 .

[鬲]
Pictogram ( 象形 ) of some pottery.

[賣]
Originally 𧷓 , an ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ) and phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *mreːs ): semantic 出 ( “ go out ” ) + phonetic 買 ( OC *mreːʔ , “ buy ” ) .
出 , which indicates exoactive semantics ( Sagart, 1999 ), was eventually reduced to the etymologically unrelated 士 .
Unrelated to 𧶠 , which is used as a phonetic component in a number of characters.

[甗]
Initially a pictogram ( 象形 ) of a two-part cooking vessel. Later 虍 was added and the cooking vessel became 鬲 , producing 鬳 .
In the current form, an ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ) and phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *ŋan, *ŋranʔ, *ŋrans ): phonetic 鬳 ( OC *ŋans , “ cooking vessel ” ) + semantic 瓦 ( “ earthenware ” ) .
