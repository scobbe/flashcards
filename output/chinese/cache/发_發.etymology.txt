[发]
Simplified from 發 and 髮 in the 1956 Chinese Character Simplification Scheme by the People's Republic of China.

[發]
Pictogram ( 象形 ) ( OC *pad ) — a bow firing an arrow. A hand ( 攴 ) was added later, forming 㢭 . The hand further turned into the phonetic component 癹 ( OC *pʰaːd, *baːd ), leading to the current form as a phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 ). [ 1 ]

[暴]
Its original form is 𫻺 and can be seen on oracle bone script; ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 虎 ( “ tiger ” ) + 戈 ( “ weapon ” ) – violence. The character also means "to expose to the sun", but its most archaic form does not convey this particular meaning.
However, by the time of bamboo slip script, usage of 𫻺 had been replaced entirely by phonetically borrowing 㬥 . This new character originates from the proto-form 𮲡, an ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 日 ( “ sun ” ) + 共 ( “ hands lifting an object ” ) ; in this precise case, the hands are lifting a plant graphically similar to 丰 or 出 . 米 (“rice”) was later added to emphasize the meaning of drying things out in the sun since rice and similar plants can be dried out in the sun. Eventually, the bottom component was stylized as the unrelated 水 and the whole character was stylized into 暴 : the plant is no more visible in the new version.
The meaning "to expose to the sun" is preserved in 𣌑 > 曝 .
