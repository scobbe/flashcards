[曹]
Originally 㯥 ( cáo ), an ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): two bundles 東 . The original meaning is "pair; peer, same kind". Later, 囗 was added as a distinguishing mark, which corrupted into 甘 in bronze inscriptions and 曰 in Seal Script, thus arriving at the intermediate character form 𣍘 . The top two 東 have merged and now resemble 曲 with an extra stroke.
Unrelated to 曲 and 典 .
