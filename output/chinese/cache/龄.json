    "interpretation": "The character 龄(líng, \"age\") is associated with \"teeth\" which can signify the process of aging. The phonetic component 令(令) (lìng, \"order\") suggests the sound. This combination conveys the concept of \"age\" or \"years,\" as teeth have cultural associations with growth and development over time.",
