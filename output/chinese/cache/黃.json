    "description": "Originally depicted 口 (kǒu, 'mouth/face') as a stylized depiction of a person or jade ring -> borrowed for 'yellow' in oracle bone script",
    "interpretation": "Originally a pictogram depicting something related to either a person or jade, 黃(黃) (huáng, 'yellow') was later phonetically borrowed for the meaning 'yellow'. The character's association with jade might also symbolize value and elegance, helping to explain its transition to the color 'yellow', often symbolic of wealth and opulence in Chinese culture.",
    "simplification": "黄 replaces 黃 by dropping the radical 田 (tián, 'field') entirely, keeping only 廿 (nián, 'twenty'), a simplified pattern for phonetic or visual resemblance."
