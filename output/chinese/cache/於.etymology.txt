Pictogram ( 象形 ). Two possibilities for the object of representation are:
• An ancient wind instrument; early form of 竽 ( OC *ɢʷa ). This view is supported by mainstream palaeography.
• Exhaled air; early form of 吁 ( OC *qʰʷa, *ɢʷas , “to sigh”). Shuowen considers it to be an ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 一 ( “ flat stream of air ” ) + 丂 ( “ to exhale ” ) . Compare 乎 , 兮 , 号 .
Unrelated to the bottom component of 得 .
