    "interpretation": "Originally depicted a three-bladed polearm, similar to 戈 but with multiple teeth. Its weapon sense was later repurposed as a phonetic loan to represent ‘I/me,’ so the modern meaning is unrelated to the original picture; the common ‘hand + halberd’ story is a folk etymology.",
