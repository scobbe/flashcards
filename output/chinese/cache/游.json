    "interpretation": "The character combines the water radical with a component originally meaning travel, highlighting both the aspect of swimming in water and wandering or traveling. This reflects the versatility in its meanings.",
    "simplification": "Traditional 遊(遊) (yóu, \"wander\") uses 辵(辵) (chuò, \"walk\") for traveling, simplified by replacing it with 水(水) (shuǐ, \"water\"), focusing on swimming, which in Chinese culture is closely related to wandering or traveling freely."
