  "etymology": {
    "type": "phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "Phonetic: 舁 (yú, \"to lift\") + Phonetic: 牙 (yá, \"tooth\") = combination of phonetic elements → final form 與 (yǔ, \"and\")",
    "interpretation": "The character 與 (yǔ, \"and\") is a combination of two phonetic elements, 舁 (yú, \"to lift\") and 牙 (yá, \"tooth\"). This unusual construction emphasizes the importance of phonetic aspects in forming the character rather than semantic meaning from components. Historically, 與 represents a similar sound derived from these components, reflecting the complex borrowing and adaptation processes in Chinese script evolution.",
    "simplification": "与 is a simplified and variant form of 與, often replacing the two phonetic components for ease of composition and visual simplicity."
