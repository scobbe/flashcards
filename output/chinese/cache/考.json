    "description": "Ideogrammic: 耂 “old man, bent over” + 丂 “walking cane” (originally drawn as 匕); an elder leaning on a cane. Structurally related to 老; often cited as 轉注 (“reciprocal meaning”) with 老.",
    "interpretation": "An elder leaning on a cane evokes age and authority, those who could judge, verify, or question others. From consulting or being tested by elders came the senses to examine, to test, and to check; in classical usage it also extended to meanings related to one’s (deceased) father.",
