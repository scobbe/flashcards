[各]
Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 夂 ( “ sole of foot ” ) + 口 – to come, to enter; original form of 𢓜 and 格 ( OC *klaːɡ, *kraːɡ ). The mouth could be referred to the entrance of a cavern or building (see 高 , 去 and 谷 ; however, this is not the case in 向 ). Compare 出 .

[名]
Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 夕 ( “ crescent moon ” ) + 口 ( “ mouth ” ) — to say one's own name to identify oneself in the dark.
An alternative theory has been proposed based on Shang era texts. 口 was originally used to write both 口 and 名 . 夕 standing for what later came to be written 明 , was added as a phonetic indicator to disambiguate the two meanings.
