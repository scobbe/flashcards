    "description": "phonetic 玄 + semantic 牛 (“cow, ox”); depicts leading an ox by hand.",
    "interpretation": "Sound is borrowed from 玄, while 牛 anchors the meaning in cattle and the act of pulling or leading. In the traditional form, a 手 element underscores the idea of guiding an ox by hand, matching senses like “to pull/lead.”",
    "simplification": "Simplified from 牽 by omitting the bottom 手 component and compressing the remaining parts, reducing strokes while retaining phonetic 玄 and semantic 牛."
