Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *zlɯːʔ, *zlɯːs ): phonetic 才 ( OC *zlɯː, *zlɯːs ) + phonetic 士 ( OC *zrɯʔ ) .
In the oracle bone script and some of the bronze inscriptions, 才 ( OC *zlɯː, *zlɯːs ) is phonetically borrowed to represent this word; a phonetic 士 ( OC *zrɯʔ ) was added later. 士 eventually corrupted into 土 (“earth”).
