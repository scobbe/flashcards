    "description": "phonetic 尹 (OC *ɢʷlinʔ) + semantic 口; OC *klun. In oracle bones and early Zhou bronzes, often interchanged with 尹; Shuowen says 口 marks commands, possibly decorative.",
    "interpretation": "Combining 尹 for sound with 口 suggests authority expressed through issuing commands. Early interchange with 尹 points to a tight link between the ideas of governing and the word’s pronunciation. The mouth element likely hints at spoken orders, even if it may have been added decoratively.",
