[女]
Pictogram ( 象形 ): a woman with breasts kneeling or standing. In the modern form, the pictogram is reversed from the Oracle Bone script form, and is "facing" toward the right edge of the character: the enclosed area (bounded on the right side by the downward-curving second stroke of the modern form) is the remnant of the figure's right breast, while the figure's left breast has disappeared.
Graphically cognate to 母 ( mǔ , “mother”) and 毋 , which has developed similarly, but also includes dots for nipples and has retained both breasts. Compare Egyptian 𓁐 .
Similar but unrelated to 卩 , in which the person kneeling has unspecified gender.

[汝]
Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *njaʔ ): semantic 水 ( “ river ; water ” ) + phonetic 女 ( OC *naʔ, *nas ) .
