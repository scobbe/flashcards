[重]
Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *doŋ, *doŋʔ, *doŋs ) and ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): semantic 人 ( “ man ” ) + phonetic 東 ( OC *toːŋ , “ bag ” ) – a man carrying a bag. A glyph 土 (“earth”) was later added to show that the bag-carrying man is standing on the ground. From this composition ( 𡍺 ) is the current form. In the modern form, the man on top can be seen as 亻 (however, the upper part of the character is unrelated to 千 ).
See also 以 , in which a person is carrying something, 央 , in which a person is carrying a pole, and 年 , in which a person is carrying the harvest.
