Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 止 ( “ foot ” ) + 一 ( “ the beginning place ” ) , originally written as 㞢 ; compound meaning “to go”. Hence, the character was similar to 出 .
Eventually, the footprint pointing upwards became a point, as in the right component of 往 (which, in this case, is unrelated to 主 ).
See also 帀 , which probably comes from the inverted version of 㞢. See also 乏 , which is thought to derive from a modification of the upper component 一.
