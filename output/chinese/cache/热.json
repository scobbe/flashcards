  "simplified": "热",

  "etymology": {
    "type": "Phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "semantic: 灬 (\"fire\") + phonetic: 埶; simplified from 熱 (埶 → 执).",
    "interpretation": "The fire component at the bottom signals heat, burning, and related thermal meanings, while 埶 originally supplied the pronunciation. In simplification, the complex phonetic 埶 was replaced by 执 for ease of writing, keeping the fire element to preserve meaning even if the new top part is not a close phonetic match in modern Mandarin.",
    "simplification": "Stroke reduction: the complex phonetic 埶 was replaced by the simpler 执 while retaining the semantic fire component (as 灬)."
