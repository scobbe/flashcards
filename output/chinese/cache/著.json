    "description": "艸(艸) (cǎo, 'grass') + 者(者) (zhě, 'person who does X') = grass-related phonetic element -> meaning relates to writing",
    "interpretation": "The character 著(著) (zhù, 'write') combines 艸(艸) (cǎo, 'grass') for semantic association with natural growth or flourish, and 者(者) (zhě, 'person who does X') for phonetic suggestion. This implies the flourishing of words, akin to the growth of plants.",
    "simplification": "The character 著 has a corrupted variant form, 着, where 艹(艹) (cǎo, 'grass') is replaced by 䒑 and 者(者) (zhě, 'person who does X') is altered to include 目(目) (mù, 'eye') based on historical orthographic changes recorded in dictionaries."
