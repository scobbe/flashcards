Pictogram ( 象形 ) – a flag on a pole with a decoration on top. Today, the flag (unrelated to 人 ) is detached from the pole with decoration, stylized as 方 . Related to 倝 but both are unrelated to 朝 .
The character today appears as 𭤨 when next to another component (e.g., 旅 and 游 ); the top component, despite its appearance, is unrelated to 伤 , 乞 , and 每 .
