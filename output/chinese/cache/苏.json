  "etymology": {
    "type": "phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "艹(艸) (cǎo, \"grass\") + 穌(穌) (sū, \"revive\") = grass reviving -> used for the surname Su",
    "interpretation": "The character 苏(蘇) (sū) combines the semantic 艹(艸) (cǎo, \"grass\") with the phonetic 穌(穌) (sū, \"revive\"). The association of grass with revival is intuitive, as grass regenerates and grows back after unfavorable conditions. This makes it a fitting character for representing regeneration or a return to life, and by extension, the surname Su.",
    "simplification": "艹(艸) (cǎo, \"grass\") retained to suggest plant-like revival, following simplification patterns common in Chinese script reform, while keeping the overall meaning recognizable."
