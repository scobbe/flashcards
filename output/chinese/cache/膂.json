    "interpretation": "Originating as a pictogram depicting two disconnected blocks, 呂(呂) was initially associated with metal and later reinterpreted as vertebrae through the addition of a connecting line, representing \u00169 (lǚ, \"spine\"). The character 呂(呂) was phonetically borrowed for this meaning, while 膂 emphasizes its anatomical sense with the addition of the 肉(肉) (ròu, \"flesh\") radical.",
