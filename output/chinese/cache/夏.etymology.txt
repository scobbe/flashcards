[夏]
In the oracle bone script, it was an ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 日 ( “ sun ” ) + 頁 ( “ head; man ” ) – man under the scorching sun; summer.
Various variants were seen in the bronze inscriptions from the Spring and Autumn period . 止 (“foot”) was often added to the bottom of the man. Additionally, in the form shown above, the 日 was removed and 𦥑 (“two hands”) was added. The seal script inherits its form from this form, with 止 replaced with the related 夊 .
Various forms were also seen from the Warring States period . The bamboo and silk script above shows a common form: 日 + 止 + 頁 . The “ancient script” ( 古文 ) from Shuowen (labelled as the large seal script) has deviated significantly, with 止 becoming the related 足 . The top part may be a corruption of 頁 .
The current form is simplified from the seal script, with the removal of 𦥑 and the legs from 頁 . Unrelated to 复 .

[复] simplified form of 復.
