Pictogram ( 象形 ) – a sugarcane with full stems, with some points around (either leaves or drops of sweet liquid) and an open and smiling mouth at the bottom. This is the original character for either 蔗 ( OC *tjaːɡs , “sugarcane”) or 煮 ( OC *tjaʔ , “to boil”). Phonetically loaned for abstract meanings.
Top component 耂 is unrelated to 老 , 考 , and 孝 .
The variant form with an additional 丶 stroke below 耂 is influenced by Shuowen , which considered 白 as the bottom component of 者 .
