  "etymology": {
    "type": "phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "害(害) (hài, \"harm\") + 刂(刂) (dāo, \"knife\") = action involving cutting with a knife -> mow",
    "interpretation": "刈(yì, \"mow\") combines 害(害) (hài, \"harm\") as the phonetic component, suggesting the sound, with 刂(刂) (dāo, \"knife\") which conveys the idea of an action involving cutting or mowing. Despite being a second-round simplified form of 割(割) (gē, \"cut\"), it retains the essence of cutting with a blade.",
    "simplification": "刈(刈) is a second-round simplification of 割(割), where sound and component reduction was achieved by directly adopting the existing form, which aligns closely with 割's function and sound."
