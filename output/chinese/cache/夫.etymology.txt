[夫]
Pictogram ( 象形 ): a variant form of 大 ( OC *daːds, *daːds ) preserving its original meaning of 夫 ( OC *pa , “man”). [ 1 ] 大 and 夫 were originally used interchangeably before settling to their current meanings. [ 2 ]
The character was later also phonetically borrowed as an instance of jiajie ( 假借 ) for 夫 ( OC *ba , “that”).
Shuowen mistakes the added horizontal stroke for a hairpin. In ancient times, when men reached the age of 20, they bound their hair with a hairpin during the Guan Li ceremony . The hairpin would thus be interpreted as the sign of “a grownup man”.
