  "simplified": "击",

  "etymology": {
    "type": "Phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "semantic: 手 “hand” + phonetic: 毄 (jī); 毄/𬆦 also means “to strike, to ram.”",
    "interpretation": "Hand indicates a manual action, while 毄 provides the sound jī. Because 毄 itself carries the idea of ramming or hitting, the combined graph naturally expresses striking with the hand.",
    "simplification": "Simplified in the PRC to 击 by adopting a long-used handwritten/abbreviated form and removing the complex 手 + 毄 structure, greatly reducing strokes while preserving the reading jī."
