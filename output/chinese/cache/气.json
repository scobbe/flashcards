    "type": "pictogram",
    "description": "pictogram: clouds flowing through the sky; traditional 氣 is phono-semantic: semantic 米 (“rice”) + phonetic 气.",
    "interpretation": "Originally a drawing of vapor drifting across the sky, capturing the idea of unseen flow and movement. The traditional form adds 米 as a semantic cue for ‘rice/gift of food’ with 气 providing the sound; its common senses of ‘air, breath’ were later borrowed from the older pictographic form.",
    "simplification": "Simplified by reverting to the ancient pictographic form 气 and dropping the 米 component from 氣, emphasizing the ‘air/steam’ sense while reducing strokes."
