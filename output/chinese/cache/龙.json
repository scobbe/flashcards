    "type": "pictogram",
    "description": "Pictogram: originally a serpent with a whiskered mouth and eyes; current standard form developed in large seal script. The simplified 龙 comes via variant 𢅛 of 龍, removing 帝 and reducing the 彡 strokes.",
    "interpretation": "Evokes a whiskered, serpentine creature with eyes and maw; later scripts abstracted the curves and details into a compact emblem. The PRC simplification streamlines earlier variants by dropping an upper element and trimming the beard strokes while keeping the dragon’s iconic silhouette.",
    "simplification": "Stroke-count reduction in script reform: removed the 帝 component from the 𢅛 variant and pared down 彡 to speed writing and improve legibility."
