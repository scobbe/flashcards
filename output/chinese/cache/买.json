    "description": "买 is the simplified form of 買 (mǎi, \"buy\"). 買 (mǎi, \"buy\") is an ideogrammic compound composed of 网 (wǎng, \"net\") + 貝 (bèi, \"money cowry\"). Another interpretation considers it a phono-semantic compound: phonetic abbreviation 羅 (luó, \"to net\") + semantic 貝 (bèi, \"money cowry\").",
    "interpretation": "The character 買 (mǎi, \"buy\") originally combined elements of a net, indicating the act of acquiring, with cowry shells, which were used as currency to signify purchase. The simplified form 买 retains the basic structure but is streamlined for easier writing.",
    "simplification": "买 is a simplified version where the complex 网 (wǎng, \"net\") component in 買 (mǎi, \"buy\") was removed, retaining the central 貝 (bèi, \"money cowry\") aspect to maintain its association with buying."
