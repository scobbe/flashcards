    "description": "semantic: 网 ‘net’ + semantic: 貝 ‘money cowrie’. Original form: 𧵽.",
    "interpretation": "Combining a net with a cowrie shell evokes catching or obtaining valuables, a visual metaphor for acquiring goods. By depicting the tools and object of value together, the graph conveys the act of procurement that later specialized to ‘buy’.",
    "simplification": "Stroke reduction: the top ‘网’ component was dropped and the shell element was compressed into the 4-stroke form 买, following the general simplification trend of 貝-based graphs."
