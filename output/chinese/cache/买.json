    "interpretation": "The traditional character 買(買) (mǎi, \"buy\") depicts a net used to capture valuable items, represented by the cowrie shell, indicating the exchange process of purchasing. This combines physical capture with the notion of economic transaction, effectively illustrating the concept of buying.",
    "simplification": "The traditional character 買(買) (mǎi, \"buy\") was simplified to 买(買) by removing the 财(財) (cái, \"wealth\") radical and using a modified net component."
