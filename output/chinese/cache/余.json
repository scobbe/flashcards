    "type": "pictogram",
    "description": "Pictogram: thatched cottage/house; originally the form of 舍, later phonetically borrowed to write 余 (“I; me”).",
    "interpretation": "Originally depicted a thatched hut and served as the graph for 舍 ‘house’. Because it sounded like the pronoun meaning ‘I; me’, the graph was borrowed for that word, and in modern usage (especially in Simplified) it also appears in ‘surplus’ senses via later phonetic borrowing.",
    "simplification": "Simplified from 餘 by dropping the food radical 飠/饣 and keeping the phonetic 余, a common simplification strategy that removes the semantic component."
