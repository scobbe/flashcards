[風]
Jiajie ( 假借 ) of 鳳 ( OC *bums , “fenghuang”) borrowed for sound to represent 風 ( OC *plum, *plums , “wind”). The right part of the bronze inscription of the character consists of phonetic 凡 ( OC *bom ) at the top, and three parts depicting the fur on the tail of the male fenghuang at the bottom.
Subsequent forms of 風 are based on the right part of its bronze inscription, with two of the three threads of "fur" removed for simplification. The 虫 in the Chu script and Qin script of 風 was likely a result of further simplification of the "fur".
Shuowen misinterpreted the character 風 by associating it with insects. ( Li, 2012 )
