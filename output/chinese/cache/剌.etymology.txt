Originally an ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 禾 ( “ cereal ” ) + 口 ( perhaps a bag or rope in this character ) + 刀 ( “ knife, blade ” ) , meaning "to cut the cereal plants, to harvest" (Ji Xusheng 季旭昇); the original shape is linked to the character 𥞥 .
On bronze inscriptions, the character was stylized into 柬 (“bag stuffed with herbs”) + 刀 (“knife, blade”) and the original meaning evolved.
