Ideogram ( 指事 ) – An inverted 曰 ( yuē ) ("to speak"), hence 亼 with a horizontal stroke at the bottom, so the inverted mouth means "not to speak".
Another theory suggests that it depicts something in the mouth. Maybe the original form of 噤 ( OC *ɡrɯmʔ, *ɡrɯms ) or 吟 ( OC *ŋɡrɯm, *ŋɡrɯms ). The derivative 含 ( OC *ɡɯːm ) refers to the original word.
