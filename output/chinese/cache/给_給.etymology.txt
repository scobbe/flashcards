[給]
According to Shuowen Jiezi, Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *krub ): semantic 糸 + phonetic 合 ( OC *kuːb, *ɡuːb ) – "rich, abundant", perhaps with a reference to precious silk; today it also means "to give". The phonetic component means "to join, to unite", however it is likely unrelated to the original meaning.
