Pictogram ( 象形 ): 首 + 卩 – head of a kneeling person, emphasising “head”.
頁 and 首 ( OC *hljuʔ, *hljus ) were originally the same pictographic character with the same meaning of “head”, and the graphical difference was that 頁 also included the body in addition to the head of the person.
頁 was later used as an alternative popular form of 葉 (“leaf; page”) to mean “sheet; page (of paper)”, which is its main meaning today.
The original sense of “head” is preserved in the radical 頁 , which is used in characters such as 頭 (“head”) and 頸 (“neck”).
