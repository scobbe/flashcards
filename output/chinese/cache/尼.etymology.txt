Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ). The character does not appear as an independent character in the oracle bone script but appears as a component of 𢓚 and 秜 . The character shows a man ( 尸 ) sitting on or leaning on another man ( 匕 ), giving the original meaning of “to stop” or “close; intimate”; the derivative 昵 refers to the latter meaning.
Shuowen Jiezi considered it as a phono-sematic compound, but this is widely discredited by later scholars.
Compare 化 , 比 , 北 , and 卬 .
