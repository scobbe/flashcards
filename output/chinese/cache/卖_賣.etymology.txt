[卖]
Simplified from 賣 ( 買 → 买 ).

[賣]
Originally 𧷓 , an ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ) and phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *mreːs ): semantic 出 ( “ go out ” ) + phonetic 買 ( OC *mreːʔ , “ buy ” ) .
出 , which indicates exoactive semantics ( Sagart, 1999 ), was eventually reduced to the etymologically unrelated 士 .
Unrelated to 𧶠 , which is used as a phonetic component in a number of characters.
