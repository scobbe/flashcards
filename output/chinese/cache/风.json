    "description": "Borrowed for sound to represent 'wind'. Right part consists of phonetic 凡, depicting fur on the tail of fenghuang.",
    "interpretation": "The character 風 originally depicted aspects of the fenghuang (a mythical bird akin to a phoenix) through phonetic borrowing. Over time, its representation related less to its original meaning of a phoenix and more to the concept of 'wind.' The bronze inscription showcases a connection to its phonetic component with visual simplifications over generations, evolving into its current form.",
    "simplification": "Simplified from 風 by replacing the phonetic element with a simpler structure, 䖝 becoming 㐅."
