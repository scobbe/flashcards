Ideogram ( 指事 ), differentiated form of 夗 ( OC *qonʔ ), which was originally the same character.
Shuowen suggests that it is an ideogram ( 指事 ) from flipped 仄 (“to tilt”) – something that can be tilted and turned; something round.
Unrelated to the right component of characters like 執 and 孰 , which comes from 丮 (a kneeling person with stretched arms to indicate "to hold").
