    "type": "pictogram",
    "description": "Pictogram (象形) of wheat; later borrowed for “to come”.",
    "interpretation": "Originally a drawing of a wheat plant, with the central ear and upward leaves, plus lines for stem and roots. The sense “to come” is a semantic loan; scribes sometimes added motion-related elements like 止 or 辵 in early periods to mark the new meaning, but those additions did not persist.",
    "simplification": "The simplified form 来 adopts a long-used abbreviated/clerical variant of 來, reducing strokes by collapsing and streamlining the original wheat-shaped elements."
