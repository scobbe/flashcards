    "interpretation": "This phrase originates from a famous poem by Ouyang Xiu, a Song dynasty scholar. The literal translation is 'the intention of the drunken old man is not in the wine.' It implies that the true interest or purpose is in something other than what is immediately apparent. The phrase suggests looking beyond the surface to understand the real motivation behind an action.",
