    "description": "𠨍 (𠨍) (two people facing each other) + 皀 (皀) (round-mouthed food vessel) -> original meaning 'to feast' -> phonetic borrowing or semantic shifting to mean 'village'",
    "interpretation": "The character initially represented two people facing a food vessel, symbolizing communal feasting, which was a central part of village life. Over time, it came to denote 'village' through borrowing or semantic shift, aligning with the social aspect it originally depicted.",
    "simplification": "乡(鄉) simplifies by using a component resembling 良(良) (liáng, 'good'), unrelated to 郎(郎) (láng, 'young man'), to streamline its form, based on 皀 during the clerical script development."
