    "type": "ideogrammic compound",
    "description": "𠨍 (“two people facing each other”) + 皀 (“round-mouthed food vessel”) → 饗 ‘to feast’; ‘village’ sense via phonetic borrowing/semantic shift.",
    "interpretation": "Originally evoked two people sharing a vessel in a ritual feast, a scene central to communal life. Through semantic shift it came to mean a community or village; the simplified 乡 preserves only a streamlined outline of the older graph.",
    "simplification": "Graphic abbreviation of 鄉 by removing the right-hand 良-like component (historically from 皀) and compressing strokes for economy."
