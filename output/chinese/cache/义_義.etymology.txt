Derived from 乂 . Originally 乂 was borrowed because of homophony and being mostly displaced by ( 刈 ). Later, to avoid confusion a stroke was added on top of 乂 to distinguish correctly. Now a homophonic character; compare 舊 → 旧

Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *ŋrals ): phonetic 我 ( OC *ŋaːlʔ ) + semantic 羊 . The component 羊 here signifies "good; beautiful; auspicious" and not "sheep". See 祥 , 善 and 幸 .
