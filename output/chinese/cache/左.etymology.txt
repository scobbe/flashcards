Originally written 𠂇 and 䶹 in the oracle bone script: Pictogram ( 象形 ) – a left hand. Compare 又 (“right hand”).
Late bronze inscription forms show an added 工 (“work; to assist?”) component, making the current form a phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *ʔsaːlʔ, *ʔsaːls ) and ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): phonetic 𠂇 ( “ left hand ” ) + semantic 工 ( “ work ” ) , representing the original form of 佐 ( OC *ʔsaːls , “to assist”).
