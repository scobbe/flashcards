[甫]
In oracle bone script, ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 屮 ( “ vegetation ” ) + 田 ( “ field ” ) – garden, original form of 圃 .
In bronze inscriptions, the components 屮 and 田 corrupted into 父 and 用 respectively. 父 ( OC *paʔ, *baʔ ) became a sound component, making the character phono-semantic ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *paʔ ).
In the modern form the components have merged into a single shape.
