    "interpretation": "The character 告(告) (gào, 'inform; announce; tell') likely evolved from a depiction related to announcing or informing others using a combination of sound (drum) and speech (mouth). The interpretation of 告(告) as a drum and mouth aligns with its meaning of announcing or speaking out loud.",
