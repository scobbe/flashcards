[丮]
Pictogram ( 象形 ) — A person kneeling with their hands stretched out, as if they are holding something.

[丸]
Ideogram ( 指事 ), differentiated form of 夗 ( OC *qonʔ ), which was originally the same character.
Shuowen suggests that it is an ideogram ( 指事 ) from flipped 仄 (“to tilt”) – something that can be tilted and turned; something round.
Unrelated to the right component of characters like 執 and 孰 , which comes from 丮 (a kneeling person with stretched arms to indicate "to hold").

[九]
Pictogram ( 象形 ) – a stylized hand, with bent wrist/forearm (hence the hook stroke at lower right). Earlier forms resemble 手 ( shǒu ) , 寸 ( cùn ) . The original meaning of the glyph was “elbow”, which is now written 肘 ( OC *tkuʔ ).
After the meaning “elbow” was forgotten, 九 was taken to symbolize a fist tightening to bump up against something; thus, there is a metaphorical bumping up of nine against ten , which is the last number when counting on one's fingers.

[鳩]
Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *ku ): phonetic 九 ( OC *kuʔ ) + semantic 鳥 ( “ bird ” ) .

[鸠]
Simplified from 鳩 ( 鳥 → 鸟 ).
