    "interpretation": "Early forms likely depict a farm tool for weeding and tilling, perhaps fashioned from a large clam shell (蜃), which helps explain later associations with times of work like morning and its role as the 5th Earthly Branch. An alternative view sees a person bracing against a cliff, a sense preserved in 振, but the graph was ultimately borrowed for calendrical timekeeping.",
