[師]
Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 𠂤 ( “ mound, hill ” ) + 帀 – ancient troops were usually stationed at a hill.
Each of the two components can be used as 師 on their own in preclassical scripts. The meaning of 帀 is "to surround"; the glyph should be the inverted version of 㞢 (> 之 ), which represents a footstep. See also 官 and 追 .
