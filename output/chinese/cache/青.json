    "type": "Phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "Phonetic: 生(生) (shēng, \"growth\") + Phonetic: 井(井) (jǐng, \"well\") = combined phonetics -> original meaning of \"color of growing plants\" -> modern meaning \"green\"",
    "interpretation": "The character 青(qīng) originally combined phonetic elements to convey the idea of 'the color of growing plants,' associating it with green due to its relation to plant life. Over time, this evolved into its current meaning of 'green.'",
    "simplification": "The second-round simplified form retained the calligraphic appearance, refining the top component 龶 to modernize the character while preserving its semantic elements."
