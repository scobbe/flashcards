    "description": "Phono-semantic (Zhang 2022): phonetic 生 (OC *sʰleːŋ, *sreŋs) + phonetic 井 (OC *skeŋʔ). Shuowen (ideogrammic): 生 (“growth of plants”) + 丹 (“cinnabar”).",
    "interpretation": "Scholarly reconstruction treats this as a phono-semantic graph drawing its sound from both 生 and 井, with meaning associated with plant growth and dye, yielding “blue-green” and by extension “pure/clear.” In modern form the top is reduced to 龶, and the bottom only resembles 月 but is unrelated to “moon.”",
