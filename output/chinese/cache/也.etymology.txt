Pictogram ( 象形 ) — A child ( 子 ) with their mouth ( 口 ) open crying. The original form of 嗁 ( OC *l'eː , “to cry”) ( Chi Hsu-Sheng, 2014 ). The child's arms were removed during bronze inscriptions and the two components fused together in the modern form.
Other various possible explanations include:
• The traditional glyph origin given in Shuowen explains the character to be a pictogram ( 象形 ) of female genitalia.
• It was once interchangeable with 它 and may have originated as a simplification. Hence, it could be the pictogram of a snake.
• It may have been created to represent the modal particle ( 語氣詞 ／ 语气词 ( yǔqìcí )). In some bronze inscriptions, it appears to be a mouth ( 口 ) with a curved line descending from it to represent air coming out of the mouth.
• It is possibly a pictogram ( 象形 ) of an ancient funnel or wash basin. It may be an early form of 匜 .
• It may have signified a big-headed scorpion with its legs flattened, signifying as something very "flat" or "stretched out".
