    "description": "门(門) (mén, \"gate\") around 关 (guān, \"to close\") = gate closure mechanism -> passage control",
    "interpretation": "The traditional character 關 (guān, \"to close\") originally incorporates the component 门(門) (mén, \"gate\") to indicate its relation to controlling a gate or passage, signifying a mechanism through which something is opened or closed. This connection to gates is consistent with the meaning of regulating or securing an area.",
    "simplification": "To create the simplified form 关, the component 门(門) (mén, \"gate\") was entirely removed, focusing on the essential closing function represented by 关."
