    "description": "semantic: 木 + phonetic: 攸",
    "interpretation": "The character 條 combines the semantic element 木, suggesting something related to wood, with the phonetic element 攸, guiding pronunciation. Initially rooted in the idea of a small branch or wooden stick, it evokes imagery of elongated, narrow objects, leading to its modern usage describing strips or items.",
    "simplification": "The character 条 was simplified by omitting the 木 radical, which reduced the number of strokes and made it easier to write."
