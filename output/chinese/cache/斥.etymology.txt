[斥]
Originally written 㡿 , a phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *ŋ̊ʰjaːɡs, *ŋ̊ʰjaːɡ ): semantic 广 ( “ building ” ) + phonetic 屰 ( OC *ŋraɡ ) .
The 屰 later came to be written 干 , and the 广 was sometimes written as 厂 , eventually leading to the modern form of the character.
Alternatively, may be derived from 宅 .
