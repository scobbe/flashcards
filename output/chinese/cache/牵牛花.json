  "etymology": {
    "type": "compound word",
    "description": "牵牛 + 花 = flower of the ‘qiānniú’ (morning glory) plant.",
    "interpretation": "Literally “cowherd/morning‑glory flower”: 牵牛 is an established plant name in Chinese (also ‘to lead an ox’ and the Cowherd star), so the compound denotes the flower of that twining vine that opens in the morning. Often also called 喇叭花 for its trumpet shape.",
    "simplification": "牵 is the simplified form of 牽, created to reduce stroke count; 牛 and 花 are unchanged. Thus the word simplifies only in the first character."
