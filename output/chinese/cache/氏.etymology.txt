[氏]
Pictogram ( 象形 ). Various interpretations exist: a man bending over to sow the field (see also 氐 > 低 and 昏 ), [ 1 ] the root of a tree (see also 柢 ), [ 2 ] a man bowing over to the right, a stick with a decoration on top to represent a clan, a spoon (according to Guo Moruo and due to similarity to 匕 ), a mallet, a man holding an object, etc.
On bronze inscriptions, a black dot was added inside the vertical stroke of the character; then, this point turned into a horizontal stroke 一 while the vertical stroke mutated into a curved trait.

[氐]
Pictogram ( 象形 ): 氏 ( “ clan; bowing figure ” ) + 一 , hence 氏 with an empty circle (then a line, today either a line or a point) underneath: perhaps a bowing figure depicted while sowing a field or the root of a tree (see 柢 ) with a mark at the bottom.
