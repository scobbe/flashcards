[离]
In bronze inscriptions, Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 林 ( “ forest ” ) + 𠦒 ( “ net ” ) – to set up a net in the forest for hunting.
The modern form descends from a variant that replaced 林 with 艸 , later simplified as 屮 in small seal script, which corrupted further into 亠 in clerical script. The bottom component 𠦒 has corrupted into ⿱凶禸 . Compare with 畢 and 禽 .
Exists as traditional character, but also simplified from 離 .

[離]
Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *reːls, *rel, *rels ): phonetic 离 ( OC *rel, *r̥ʰel ) + semantic 隹 ( “ bird ” ) – black-naped oriole ( Oriolus chinensis ). This sense is preserved in the compound 離黃 .
Phonetically borrowed for the sense "to depart".
