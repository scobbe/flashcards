Pictogram ( 象形 ) of a tool—chisel, awl, spike—used to mark slaves and criminals. The characters 䇂 and 亲 are two variants. The former (䇂) is the original version, while the latter is a conflation of both 亲 and 𣓀 , a chisel over a tree to indicate the hazelnut branch which was flexible enough to be used as a whip.
It appears as 立 on the top of characters such as 妾 , 竟 , and 童 . Unrelated to 音 and 競 , in which it represents the tip of a tongue on top of an open mouth. See also 辡 . See also the top component of 商 .
