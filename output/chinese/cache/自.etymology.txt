[自]
Pictogram ( 象形 ): a nose — original form of 鼻 ( OC *blids , “nose”). Later phonetically borrowed as an instance of jiajie ( 假借 ) for 自 ( OC *ɦljids , “oneself; from”).
Folk etymology considers the meaning to arise from a habit of pointing at one’s nose to indicate oneself.

[白]
Unclear; probably a pictogram ( 象形 ).
Guo (1954) suggests that it represents a thumb and is original form of 拇 ( *mɯʔ ) or, more probably, 擘 ( *preːɡ ) .
Alternatively, Unger ( apud Schuessler, 2007) suggests that it represents an acorn, noting its use in 樂 / 乐 ( “ oak ” ) (= 櫟 / 栎 ) and 皂 ( zào , “ acorn ” ) . In this interpretation, the meaning of “white” is derived from the color of an acorn's inside. Unrelated to the top component of 原 .

[日]
Pictogram ( 象形 ) – the sun. A dot or line was added in the centre to distinguish it from visually similar characters, e.g. 囗 (early form of 丁 ). Compare earlier forms of the character with the astronomical and astrological symbol for the Sun ( ☉ ) and the Egyptian hieroglyph 𓇳 .
