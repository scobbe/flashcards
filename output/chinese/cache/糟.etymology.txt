[糟]
Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *ʔsluː ): semantic 米 + phonetic 曹 ( OC *zluː ) . The original version is 𥽾 . The radical of the rice perhaps is a reference to the liquor made out of fermented rice (see for instance 鬯 ) and the original meaning is "unfiltered", referred for instance to liquor and wine.
