[丁]
Pictogram ( 象形 ) – different theories exist:
• the head of a nail. The derivative 釘 is now used to represent this sense. This interpretation was formulated by Liu Xinyuan (劉心源), Lin Yiguang (林義光), and Wu Qichang (吳其昌).
• a head. The derivative 天 and 頂 is now used to represent this sense. Characters like 元 contain it as a semantic component. This is interpretation was formulated by Gao Hongjin (高鴻縉) and could be linked to the first interpretation ("head of a nail").
• a city wall. In ancient China, city walls were square-shaped. The derivative 成 and later 城 is now used to represent this sense. The character 正 ／ 征 contains it as a semantic component (but in 邑 , the top component is 囗 , not 丁). This interpretation was formulated by He Linyi (何琳儀).
