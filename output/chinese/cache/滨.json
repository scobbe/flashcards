    "description": "semantic: 氵(氵) (shuǐ, \"water\") + phonetic: 賓(賓) (bīn, \"guest\") = water near guest -> shore",
    "interpretation": "The character 滨(濱) (bīn, \"shore\") combines 水(shuǐ, \"water\"), representing the water characteristic of a shore, with 賓(bīn, \"guest\"), which provides the pronunciation. This formation suggests a place where guests might arrive by water, reflecting coastal regions.",
    "simplification": "濱(濱) was simplified by removing parts of the 賓(bīn, \"guest\") component that were deemed less essential for maintaining pronunciation, while keeping the overall structure recognizable."
