Unlike 一 , which was one horizontal stroke meaning one, 十 was originally simply a vertical stroke. In later forms 一 was added, forming a cross.
Possibly a pictogram ( 象形 ) for a needle, later written as 針 ( OC *kjum, *kjums ), borrowed phonetically for 十 ( OC *ɡjub , “ten”).
Unrelated to 支 , 卖 , 直 , 真 , 德 , 甫 ， and 七 but related to the original version of 丈 and perhaps related to 由 .
The notion that 針 / 针 ( zhēn ) belongs to the same series as 十 ( shí ) is not generally accepted. If they are separated, Baxter-Sagart's reconstruction can be amended to *[g][i]p .
