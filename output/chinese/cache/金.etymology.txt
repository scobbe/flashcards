Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *krɯm ): semantic 士 ( “ upside-down ritual axe perhaps made of precious materials ” ) + semantic 呂 ( “ two blocks of metal ” ) + phonetic 亼 ( OC *krɯm ) . The semantic component in folk etymology is very often misinterpreted as 王 . The blocks of metal were originally drawn as : and then as 丷 .
The upper component 亼 is the ancient form for 今 ( OC *krɯm ) and it represents an open mouth flipped upside down; it indicates the original pronunciation of the whole character.
Shuowen interprets it as an image of metal in the earth (Xu Shen writes "象金在土中形") with 亼 as phonetic. But the most ancient versions do not contain the pictogram of the earth.
Originally referred to copper , first used during the Copper Age and the Jade Age in China (hence before the Bronze Age, during which the first bronzes were produced); later the meaning was extended to metal as a whole, and then to gold .
