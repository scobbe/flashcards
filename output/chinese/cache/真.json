    "type": "phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "Originally phono-semantic: semantic 貝 (“cowry”) + phonetic 𠂈; later 丁 was added as a second phonetic. 𠂈 → 十 (modern) / 匕 (seal); bottom from 貝 + 丁 → 目 + 丌.",
    "interpretation": "It began as a value-related graph with 貝 indicating preciousness and a blade-like 𠂈 providing the sound; 丁 later reinforced the phonetic side. Over time these parts were regularized into the modern shape with 十 over 目 and a base derived from older 貝/丁 forms, while the meaning shifted toward “genuine/true.”",
