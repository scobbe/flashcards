    "interpretation": "Earliest forms depict a central marker—pole and drum—used to gather people and signal direction, embodying the idea of a center point. The later abstraction of a vertical line piercing a square visually encodes “through the middle,” while the bullseye/arrow reading reinforces the notion of centrality and precision.",
