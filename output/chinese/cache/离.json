    "type": "ideogrammic compound",
    "description": "ideogrammic: 林 ‘forest’ + 𠦒 ‘net’ — to set up a net in the forest; later evolved via 艸 > 屮 > 亠 and 𠦒 > ⿱凶禸.",
    "interpretation": "Originally depicts setting a net in the woods for hunting, evoking the idea of separating or taking away. The graphic was later stylized into 离, and its meaning generalized to leaving or being apart; it was also repurposed as the simplified form of 離.",
    "simplification": "The PRC adopted the historically attested, simpler graph 离 to replace 離, effectively dropping the semantic 隹 ‘bird’ and retaining the phonetic 离, reducing strokes while preserving pronunciation and common meanings."
