[亼] second-round simplified and ancient form of 集.

[今]
Ideogram ( 指事 ) – An inverted 曰 ( yuē ) ("to speak"), hence 亼 with a horizontal stroke at the bottom, so the inverted mouth means "not to speak".
Another theory suggests that it depicts something in the mouth. Maybe the original form of 噤 ( OC *ɡrɯmʔ, *ɡrɯms ) or 吟 ( OC *ŋɡrɯm, *ŋɡrɯms ). The derivative 含 ( OC *ɡɯːm ) refers to the original word.

[集]
Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 隹 ( “ bird ” ) + 木 ( “ tree ” ) . The variant 雧 ( jí ) shows three birds instead.

[隼]
The upper component is a reference to a bird with a short tail, in this case a falcon, and is used both as a semantic and phonetic component. Originally, it was written as 鵻 . Then it became 隼 and eventually 鶽 .
