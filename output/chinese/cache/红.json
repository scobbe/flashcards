  "etymology": {
    "type": "Phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "semantic: 糸 (silk) + phonetic: 工",
    "interpretation": "Combines the silk component 糸 with 工 as the phonetic, pointing to a reading similar to gōng in Old Chinese and associating the meaning with textiles. The color sense likely came from the hue of dyed silk, later extending to figurative uses like popularity and revolutionary connotations.",
    "simplification": "Simplified from 紅 by reducing 糹 to 纟 to lower stroke count and standardize the silk radical in simplified characters."
