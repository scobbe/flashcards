    "description": "貝(貝) (bèi, \"cowry\") + 人(人) (rén, \"person\") = person with a burden -> carrying valuables -> 負(負)",
    "interpretation": "The traditional character 負(負) (fù, \"carry on the back\") combines 貝(貝) (bèi, \"cowry\") representing value or burden, and 人(人) (rén, \"person\") indicating a person bearing this burden. This conveys the action of carrying something valuable, often on the back.",
    "simplification": "Initially, 负(負) shared the same form since they are the same word, so this character doesn't have a simplified form."
