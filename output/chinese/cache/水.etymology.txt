Pictogram ( 象形 ) of water flowing; sometimes written as the variant 氺 (e.g., 泰 , 录 , and 黎 ). Next to a character, it is compressed and stylized into 氵 (which is unrelated to 冫 ).
Compare 川 ( OC *kʰjon ) and its variant 巛 . Compare also 永 and its cognate 𠂢 . See also the bottom part of 原 in its original version ( 厡 ).
