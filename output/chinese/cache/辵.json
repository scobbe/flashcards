    "interpretation": "The character 辵 combines 彳(彳) (chì, \"walk\"), which represents movement, with 止(止) (zhǐ, \"foot\" or \"to stop\"), suggesting the concept of stepping or traveling forward. This character represents the idea of movement, particularly the action of walking or traveling, as originally depicted by the more conservative form 𣥆. Over time, the bottom component has been stylized as 龰, forming the current representation.",
