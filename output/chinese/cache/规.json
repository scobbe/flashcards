    "type": "pictogram (originally); later ideogrammic compound",
    "description": "Originally a pictogram: a cross-shaped measuring compass. Later reformulated as 夫 (“husband”) + 見 (“see”) (traditionally ideogrammic); Smith (2011) suggests the left abbreviates phonetic 癸, while Chen (2021) links the left to 矩.",
    "interpretation": "Earliest forms sketched a measuring compass directly, then later scribes reanalyzed it as 夫 + 見 to evoke observing or measuring by a rule. Some scholars see a phonetic echo of 癸 on the left, and others align its semantics with tool characters like 矩.",
    "simplification": "Mainly replaced 見 with 见 as a regular component simplification; the left 夫 was retained."
