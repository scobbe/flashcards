Pictogram ( 象形 ) – a kneeling man or figure with an ugly face ( 甶 ). The ugly face could be a mask. The lower right “dot” is a small 厶 ; it is a residual tail that was added later – compare 离 . Related to 畏 (variant 𠂽 ), which originally depicts a ghost standing with a stick in hand.
Compare 異 (“different, strange”), in which the 田 also derives from a face and indicates a mask. Compare also 禺 , in which the top component represents either a mask or a monkey's head.
