Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *hljeb, *leb ): semantic 艸 + phonetic 枼 ( “ leaf ” ) . 枼 is the original pictogram for this word; 艸 was added to differentiate. [ 1 ]

Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *ɦleːb ): semantic 口 + phonetic 十 ( OC *ɡjub ) – an ancient variant form of 協 ( OC *ɦleːb , “to cooperate”) used since antiquity.
