Li Shoukui (2016): Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *ɡʷreːɡs, *ɡʷreːɡ ): semantic 聿 ( “ brush ” ) + phonetic 規 ( OC *kʷel ) . 規 (“compass”) appears in the oracle bone script in its pictographic protoform resembling a 乂 . During the Western Zhou period, 周 was added as seen in the bronze inscriptions.
Traditionally explained as an ideogrammic compound of 聿 ("brush") + 画 ("a field ( 田 ) enclosed on four sides"). However, the ancient scripts do not depict a field.
