[朝]
In the oracle bone script, it was an ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 2 or 4 屮 (“grass”) or even 木 (“tree”) + 日 (“sun”) + 月 (“moon”) – the sun rising above the ground while the waning moon is still in the sky – the morning.
In the bronze script, it was a compound of 𠦝 and a pictograph of a river ( 川 or 水 ) – this was possibly an original form for 潮 ( OC *r'ew , “tide”). The river glyph may be a corruption of 月 due to association with tides or diurnal events. Chi (2010) considers such forms to be phono-semantic ( 形聲 / 形声 ), where 𠦝 is the abbreviated form of the phonetic 朝 ( OC *ʔr'ew, *r'ew ). In the some late Western Zhou forms, 𠦝 was corrupted into a form resembling 車 .
According to Guo Moruo , in the stone drum inscriptions ( 石鼓文 ( shígǔwén ) , likely from the Spring and Autumn period ) 㫃 was added (attached to 車 ), and the river glyph was replaced with 舟 ( OC *tjɯw ), which was interpreted as the phonetic component; the small seal script might have inherited from this form. Shuowen interpreted the fused components of 𠦝 and 㫃 as a semantic component 倝 (“dawn”). However, the accuracy of identification has been questioned; the character was a heavily weathered one in which the 㫃 identification was probably spurious and likely influenced by the Shuowen . Meanwhile, the 舟 component on the right remained somewhat legible. [ 1 ]
The 舟 component remained in the bamboo and wooden slips of the Warring States period (see the table). In the clerical script since the Han dynasty , 舟 had been reverted to 月 ; it is unclear whether this was a remnant from 月 in the oracle bone script or a corruption of 舟 (as in 朕 < 𦩎 and many other characters). The current form is essentially inherited from the clerical script.
