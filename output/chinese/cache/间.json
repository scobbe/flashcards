    "description": "semantic: 門 ‘gate’ + 日 ‘sun’; variant of 閒 with 月 replaced by 日.",
    "interpretation": "Sun seen through a gate evokes an opening or gap, extending to ideas of space, interval, and the area inside (a room). Replacing the moon with the sun preserves the same visual of light through a doorway, reinforcing the notion of an in-between space.",
    "simplification": "門 was simplified to 门; the inner 日 was retained. This reduces strokes and aligns 间 with other 门-family simplifications."
