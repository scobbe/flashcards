    "type": "phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "semantic: 艹 (cǎo, \"grass\") + phonetic: 枼 (yè, \"leaf\") = vegetation-like and phonetic element -> leaf",
    "interpretation": "In 叶(葉) (yè, \"leaf\"), the 艹 (cǎo, \"grass\") component suggests vegetation, while 枼 (yè, \"leaf\") provides the sound. This combination aptly conveys the meaning of a leaf, aligning both meaning and pronunciation.",
    "simplification": "In the simplified form 叶(葉), the component 艹 (cǎo, \"grass\") is removed, and 枼 (yè, \"leaf\") alone suggests both the phonetic and semantic aspects, reducing the complexity by focusing solely on the phonetic element."
