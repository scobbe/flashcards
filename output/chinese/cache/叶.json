    "type": "Phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "semantic: 口 + phonetic: 十 (ancient variant of 協); later borrowed to write 葉.",
    "interpretation": "Combines 口 as the semantic element and 十 as the phonetic, forming an old variant of 協 ‘to cooperate’. Due to homophony with 葉 in some Northern Wu varieties, this form was repurposed to write ‘leaf’ and was later standardized as the simplified character.",
    "simplification": "Adopted an existing, simpler variant 叶 (originally tied to 協) as the simplified form for 葉 because of homophony; it replaced 艹+枼 with 口+十."
