[器]
Uncertain. The classical interpretation is an ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): a 犬 (“dog”) guarding four 口 (“vessels”).
It might also be a phonetically borrowed character, originally meaning “to bark ” (Compare 狺 ).
Another theory states the character is derived from 喪 (“mourning”). (Compare 噩 , 哭 , 咢 ). Borrowed not for sound but as an ideogram ( 指事 ) referring to a funerary urn.
