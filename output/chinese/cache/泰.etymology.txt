[泰]
Originally a Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *tʰaːds ): phonetic 大 ( OC *daːds, *daːds ) + semantic 廾 ( “ two hands ” ) + semantic 水 ( “ water ” ) . A more conservative variant is 𡙌 . The 大 and 廾 later fused into 𡗗 . The original meaning according to Shuowen Jiezi was "to slip", perhaps with a reference to seize something wet or to seize a liquid with bare hands. Then it became "too <much>", which was written either as 太 or 𡙌 > 泰 or as its variant 冭 , perhaps due to the influence of its pronunciation and/or the top component of the character, which has a reference to a great quantity. As a result of the changed meaning, it may have been reinterpreted as an Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): semantic 大 ( “ big; great ” ) + semantic 廾 ( “ two hands ” ) + semantic 水 ( “ water ” ) .

[奉]
Originally phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *boŋʔ ): phonetic 丰 ( OC *pʰoŋ ) + semantic 廾 ( “ two hands ” ) ， hence the original version is 𠬻 . 手 (“hand”) was later added at the bottom, and the original character was corrupted into 𡗗 . Related to 舉 .

[秦]
In the oracle bone script , an ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 午 (“pestle”, the original form of 杵 ) + 廾 (“two hands”) + two 禾 (“grain”). The most conservative variant is 𥢮 . A form of its bronze inscription containing only one 禾 developed into the subsequent small seal script form in Shuowen . The 午 and 廾 components have fused into 𡗗 in the modern form.
According to Shuowen Jiezi , the glyph is an ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): abbreviated 舂 ( “ to pound grain ” ) + 禾 ( “ grain ” ) – husked grain. However this would necessitate a phonological shift that is considered unlikely, and furthermore is likely a folk etymology altogether. [ 1 ]
