Oracle bone script: Pictogram ( 象形 ): a jade artifact with carved patterns. Original form of 彫 ( OC *tɯːw , “to carve”). The character was later borrowed as a country name and 口 was added as a distinguishing mark. A semi-conservative version in which the carvings are visible is 𠕛 . The top part of the character gradually became similar to 用 in the late Western Zhou period. [ 1 ] See also 黃 , which could have a reference to a jade artifact.
Folk etymology interprets the seal script form as 口 (“mouth”) + 用 (“to use”), indicating the idea of using words skillfully to express oneself, thereby implying the meaning of being meticulous or detailed. [ 2 ]
