    "interpretation": "Initially, 悤(悤) (cōng, \"clever\") depicted a heart with a dot, symbolizing intelligence through the concept of 'holes on the heart'. This idea is rooted in traditional Chinese symbolism. Over time, its form evolved to a patterned shape during the Han dynasty, ultimately influencing the character's meaning shift but preserving its essence in 聰(聰) (cōng, \"intelligent\").",
