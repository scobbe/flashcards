Original form was 恖 ( OC *snɯ ), considered by Shuowen to be a phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *snɯ, *snɯs ): phonetic 囟 ( OC *snɯns ) + semantic 心 ( “ heart ” ) . It may also be a ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 囟 ( “ fontanel ” ) + 心 ( “ heart ” ) .
囟 started to corrupt into the unrelated 田 as early as the silk script.
