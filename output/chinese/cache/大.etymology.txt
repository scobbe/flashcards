Pictogram ( 象形 ): a person facing forward. Original form of 夫 ( OC *pa, *ba , “man”), phonetically borrowed for 大 ( OC *daːds, *daːds , “big”). Compare 人 , which represents the profile of a person.
Often explained as an ideogram of a person with outstretched arms; however, the ancient scripts do not show stretching.
Compare with 尢 , which is a man with bent legs. Compare also 立 , similar to 大 , and 交 , in which the legs are crossed. Compare also 文 , which is a man with arms outstretched and a crest or tattoo on his chest, and to 夭 , which is a man with arms outstretched and leaning to side (running or marching vigorously).
See the top component of 泰 in the original version ( 𡙌 ), the top component of 赤 and the bottom component of 奐 (well visible in some fonts). Related to 太 .
Unrelated to 买 , in which the bottom component is the stylization of a cowrie.
