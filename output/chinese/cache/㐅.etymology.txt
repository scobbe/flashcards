[㐅]
Found in the Shuowen Jiezi 《 說文解字 ( Shuōwén Jiězì ) 》 etymological dictionary.

[五]
Originally written 𠄡 , consisting of 㐅 with a bar on the top and bottom. Original meaning is unclear. Theories include:
• Yu Shenwu: a tally mark.
• Ding Shan: original form of 互 ( OC *ɡaːs , “to cross”).
• Zhang Bingquan: Pictogram ( 象形 ): palm lines from extending ones fingers
• Ji Xusheng: 亖 (“four”) with an added stroke.
In 韋 , the upper component ( 𫝀 ) is the stylization of a footprint, hence it is similar but unrelated to 五.

[伍]
Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *ŋaːʔ ): semantic 亻 + phonetic 五 ( OC *ŋaːʔ ) . Also ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ).
