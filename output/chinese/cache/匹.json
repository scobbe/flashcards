    "description": "Uncertain; Shuowen: ideogrammic/phono-semantic — semantic 匸 (“conceal”) + phonetic 八 (“eight”), a cloth-measure idea (not supported by earliest forms).",
    "interpretation": "Later scholars linked 八 to the notion of ‘eight folds’ and 匸 to ‘concealing’ the ends when rolling cloth, to explain its use as a cloth measure. Early inscriptions don’t clearly show these parts, so the form likely began as an abstract or non-decomposable sign that was later reinterpreted and extended to senses like ‘to match’ and as a classifier.",
