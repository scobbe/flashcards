Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *kreː, *kreː ): semantic 行 + phonetic 圭 ( OC *kʷeː ) .
Originally, the phonetic component is not related to the concept of earth ( 土 ) since in its original form it represents a pair of ritual axes perhaps made of jade 士 . Hence, the link to the concept of earth in this character and 厓 either comes from folk etymology or its appearance in the Small Seal script.
