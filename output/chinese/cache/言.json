    "description": "Ideogram: formed by adding a horizontal stroke to ancient 舌 to show tongue movement (speech). Shuowen erroneously treats it as phono-semantic: phonetic 䇂 (qiān) + semantic 口 (“mouth”).",
    "interpretation": "Built on 舌 (tongue), an added stroke marks motion, abstracting the act of speaking into a simple sign for “speech/words.” Later standardization added a dot on top and simplified the tongue shape, moving from a pictorial tongue to a conventional symbol for utterance. The Shuowen’s phono-semantic reading is a historical misinterpretation rather than the true origin.",
