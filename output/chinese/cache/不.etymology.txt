Pictogram ( 象形 ): the calyx of a flower. 不 was then composed into a phono-semantic character with the pictograph for mouth ( 口 ), to form 否 ( OC *brɯʔ, *pɯʔ ), representing “no” (negation). This composed meaning then spread back to the original character 不 , making it a synonym of 否 . A new character of 柎 ( OC *po ) was eventually created to represent the original meaning of calyx.
Following Shuowen ’s interpretation, Karlgren and Wieger interpret it as a bird flying toward the sky ( 一 ). The sky being the limit for the bird, thus the idea of negation.
