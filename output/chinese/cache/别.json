    "type": "ideogrammic compound (會意)",
    "description": "會意: 冎 “bone” + 刂 “knife”, hence 𠛰 ‘to cut up bone and flesh’; later stylized as 別. 别 is a variant where 𠮠 is replaced with visually similar 另; officially adopted in 1956 as the simplified form of 彆.",
    "interpretation": "Combines the ideas of bone and knife to depict cutting apart, which extends to meanings like separating and distinguishing. Over time the form was streamlined, and modern 别 uses 另 on the left for ease and resemblance to the older shape.",
    "simplification": "The left component 𠮠 was replaced by 另 to reduce strokes and improve legibility; PRC reform also merged 彆/別 to the single simplified form 别 (1956)."
