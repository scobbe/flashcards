[瓶]
Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *beːŋ ): phonetic 并 ( OC *peŋ, *peŋs ) + semantic 瓦 ( “ earthenware ” ) . According to the radical, it originally indicates an earthenware vessel, i.e., not a glass bottle. It had a long slender neck opening up to a narrow mouth. However, 瓶 was also part of ritual bronzes in ancient China, hence it was made of bronze when used during rituals.
Today, it indicates bottles of any kind and dimension.
