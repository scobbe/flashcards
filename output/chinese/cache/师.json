    "type": "ideogrammic compound (会意)",
    "description": "𠂤 (“mound, hill”) + 帀 (“to surround”); simplified by replacing 𠂤 with 刂.",
    "interpretation": "A hill combined with the idea of encircling evokes troops camped around a rise, yielding the sense of an army and, by extension, a master/teacher who leads or trains. The simplified form keeps the encampment idea while swapping the hill for the knife component, leaving the core meaning intact.",
    "simplification": "𠂤 was replaced with 刂 to reduce strokes, paralleling the simplification 帅 ← 帥; a graphic streamlining without phonetic or semantic reanalysis."
