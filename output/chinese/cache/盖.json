    "type": "phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "semantic: 艸 (grass) + phonetic: 盍",
    "interpretation": "蓋 is a phono-semantic compound with 艸 representing the semantic element related to grass, hinting at the character's meaning related to covering, possibly with a thatch. The phonetic element 盍 shares pronunciation with the character and initially signified 'cover.' Over time, as 盍's use broadened, 蓋 took over the specific meaning related to covering or tops.",
    "simplification": "盖 is a simplified form by reducing strokes and omitting the 艸 component in 蓋."
