[白]
Unclear; probably a pictogram ( 象形 ).
Guo (1954) suggests that it represents a thumb and is original form of 拇 ( *mɯʔ ) or, more probably, 擘 ( *preːɡ ) .
Alternatively, Unger ( apud Schuessler, 2007) suggests that it represents an acorn, noting its use in 樂 / 乐 ( “ oak ” ) (= 櫟 / 栎 ) and 皂 ( zào , “ acorn ” ) . In this interpretation, the meaning of “white” is derived from the color of an acorn's inside. Unrelated to the top component of 原 .
