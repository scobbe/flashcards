    "interpretation": "The character 由(由) (yóu, 'cause') was originally a phono-semantic compound, combining 十(十) (shí, 'ten') as the phonetic component with 口(口) (kǒu, 'mouth') as the semantic component. This represents a container, indicating an ancient pronunciation. The character also has historical associations with oracle bone script and was an original form of 怞(怞) (yóu, 'cause'), indicating the character's evolution from a depiction of an item to its modern meaning.",
