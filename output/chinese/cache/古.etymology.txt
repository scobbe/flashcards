[古]
Ideogram ( 指事 ): A shield ( 十 , contraction of 盾 and similar but unrelated to 中 ) and the radical of the mouth ( 口 ) both as a distinguishing mark and as a component that partly indicates pronunciation. Together, they indicate the concept of "strong, firm" (as strong as a shield); original form of 固 ( OC *kaːs ) (Qiu Xigui, Ding Shan 丁山). Compare oracle bone forms with 干 , 盾 . Unrelated to 中 and hence to 史 and 使 .
Fang (1982) finds evidence for the 十 component originally being a depiction of a piece of food and the character originally being a depiction of someone spitting out a piece of food due to his bad taste. Thus, Fang argues this character is the original form of 苦 ( kǔ ), "bitter".

[吉]
Ideogram ( 指事 ) derived from a ritual axe 士 and an open mouth 口 , perhaps with a reference to rituals to obtain the gratitude of the ancestors and deities.
