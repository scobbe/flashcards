  "etymology": {
    "type": "pictogram",
    "description": "Pictogram of wheat: middle line = ear, upward lines = leaves, downward lines = stem/roots; sometimes an extra top line. Borrowed early to mean “to come”; later additions like 止/辵 were not retained.",
    "interpretation": "Originally drew a stalk of wheat, with the central stroke as the ear and other strokes as leaves, stem, and roots. It was borrowed early to write “to come,” while 麥 later carried the grain meaning; their similar Old Chinese onsets likely facilitated the semantic shift.",
    "simplification": "Simplified to 来 by reducing and regularizing strokes, following common clerical/cursive forms to lower stroke count and ease writing."
