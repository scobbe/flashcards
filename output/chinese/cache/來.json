    "description": "Depicts wheat: middle line = ear, upward lines = leaves, downward lines = stem and roots -> horizontal line highlighted the ear -> borrowed for 'to come'",
    "interpretation": "The character originally depicted wheat, visually representing its structure. It was borrowed for its phonetic similarity to express the concept 'to come.' Over time, this borrowed meaning became predominant, while the original reference to wheat became associated with 麥(麥) (mài, 'wheat') through additional phonetic differentiation.",
    "simplification": "来 is a simplified form of 來 with fewer strokes, maintaining a similar appearance for ease of writing."
