    "description": "semantic 出 (“go out”) + phonetic 買 (“buy”); later 出 reduced to 士; simplified from 賣 (買 → 买).",
    "interpretation": "Combines the 'go out' idea (出) with the sound from 'buy' (買), evoking goods taken out to be sold. Over time the top component was reduced to 士, and the simplified form replaces 買 with 买 while keeping the same pronunciation and sense.",
    "simplification": "Replaced 買 with its simplified form 买 to reduce strokes; the top component remained as 士. Overall simplified from 賣."
