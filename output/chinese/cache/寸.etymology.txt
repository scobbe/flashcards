[寸]
Two separate characters with this form exist:
• Jiajie ( 假借 ): abbreviated form of 尊 ( OC *ʔsuːn ), borrowed to refer to 寸 ( OC *sʰuːns , “a unit of measurement”). [ 1 ]
• Ideogram ( 指事 ): a line on the hand, emphasizing the elbow. Original form of 肘 ( OC *tkuʔ , “elbow”).
Shuowen considered it to represent a position on the forearm where the pulse can be palpated by compressing the radial artery . It is called 寸口 in modern Chinese, and the meaning of a unit of measurement is derived from the distance between the wrist and this position.
