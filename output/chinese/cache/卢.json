    "type": "phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "Pictogram of an oven -> phonetic 虍 (hū, \"tiger\") added + semantic 田 (\"oven\") + semantic 皿 (\"vessel\") = shaped oven character -> simplified to 卢 (lú) in cursive script",
    "interpretation": "The character originally depicted an oven, which was represented in bronze inscriptions with 虍 (hū, \"tiger\") for phonetic value and both 田 and 皿 indicating cooking or containment. It was later simplified to 卢 (lú) in cursive script, while its original meaning shifted to be represented by 爐.",
    "simplification": "卢 is a cursive shorthand of 盧 (lú), adopting a simpler form while retaining phonetic similarity."
