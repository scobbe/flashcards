[黑]
Pictogram ( 象形 ) – a person ( 大 ) with a tattooed face, depicting penal tattooing ( 墨 and 黥 ), one of the five punishments of ancient China.
In the bronze inscriptions from the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, dots were sometimes added around 大 , leading Shuowen to erroneously interpret the character as an ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 𡆧 ( “ chimney ” ) + 炎 ( “ fire; flame ” ) — fire burning under a chimney, causing it to become black from the smoke.
This word displaced the earlier word for "black", 玄 . Unrelated to 熏 .

[黒]
Variant of 黑 . Simplified from 黑 , replacing two dots with one stroke. The modern Japanese usage is of reform (shinjitai) nature. Compare 毋 , the shinjitai of 母 .
