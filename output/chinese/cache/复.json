    "type": "ideogram (复); phono-semantic compound (traditional 復)",
    "description": "ideogram: top depicts a room in a corridor + bottom 夊 “foot/step” (‘go back’); traditional 復 is semantic 彳 ‘walk’ + phonetic 复.",
    "interpretation": "A footprint returning toward a room conveys the idea of going back, hence ‘return/again’. Later, the walker radical 彳 was added to form 復, clarifying the motion sense while keeping 复 as the sound and core idea.",
    "simplification": "PRC simplification adopted the older phonetic form 复 by dropping the semantic 彳 from 復, effectively reverting to the original graphic that already expressed ‘return’."
