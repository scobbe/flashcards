    "description": "Simplified from 導 (道 → 巳); original 導 is phono-semantic: semantic 寸 (“hand”) + phonetic 道 (“path”).",
    "interpretation": "In the traditional form, a hand (寸) leads someone along a road (道), conveying the idea of guiding. The simplification replaces the complex 道 with 巳 to reduce strokes, keeping the hand component and core meaning while weakening the original phonetic cue.",
    "simplification": "Replaced the complex phonetic 道 with the simpler 巳 to lower stroke count while retaining the semantic 寸."
