[麥]
Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *mrɯːɡ ): phonetic 來 ( OC *m·rɯːɡ ) + semantic 夊 ( “ footprint pointing down; to walk slowly ” ) ; according to Xu Shen, its meaning is "wheat". 來 was the original character for “wheat”.
Several possible interpretations for the glyph:
• This character is a differentiation from 來 , which originally meant "wheat". It was then phonetically borrowed since the oracle bones to mean "to come". During the Warring States period, 麥 is attested and perhaps was coined specifically to mean "come". Eventually, since 來 lost its original meaning, this meaning shifted to 麥 .
• 夊 represents the ancient concept reported by Shuowen Jiezi that wheat came from the heavens (i.e., the Fertile Crescent).
• 夊 represents growth of the wheat plant.
