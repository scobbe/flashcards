    "description": "Pictogram: four dots (like grains of sand) indicating “a few, a little”; phonetically borrowed from 小 (“small,” depicted by three dots). Unrelated to 步.",
    "interpretation": "Originally depicted a small cluster of dots, evoking a tiny quantity such as grains of sand, hence the sense “few; little.” Its form and sound link to 小, which also shows small marks and means “small,” but it is not connected to 步/歲 despite visual resemblance.",
