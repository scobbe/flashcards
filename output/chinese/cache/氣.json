    "interpretation": "Originally, 氣(qì, 'air') represented giving rice as a gift, reflecting physical exchange and transformation. Over time, it was borrowed to denote the concepts of 'air' and 'flow', abstractly related to the movement and circulation of gases.",
    "simplification": "The character 氣 was simplified to 气 by omitting the 米 (mǐ, 'rice') component, retaining only the phonetic element."
