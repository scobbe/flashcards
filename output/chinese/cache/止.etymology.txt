Pictogram ( 象形 ) – a footprint pointing up, originally meaning "foot"; stylized as 龰 . The derivative 趾 ( OC *kjɯʔ ) refers to the original meaning. Compare 手 (“hand”). Note that in oracle script, composed of 3 toes and a sole.
Compare to 夊 , 夂 , which have similar shape in oracle script, but pointing down (toe pointing right), and 𡕒 (as in right side of 舛 , roughly ヰ , toe pointing left), hence different evolution.
Compare to 丑 , which is the pictogram of an animal claw.
Eventually, note that the foot is represented with three toes, like the human hand in the characters 爪 , 寸 , 九 , 又 , and 彐 .
