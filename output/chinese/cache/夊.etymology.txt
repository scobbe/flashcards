[夊]
Pictogram ( 象形 ) – footprint (pointing down), variant of 夂 . Compare 止 , which has similar form in oracle script, but has leg pointing up, and 𡕒 (as in right side of 舛 , roughly ヰ ), which also has leg pointing down, but toe pointing left, hence different evolutions.

[夂]
Pictogram ( 象形 ) of a footprint pointing down. See 夊 ( suī ) , which represents a variant of this character.
Shuowen : Ideogram ( 指事 ) – two legs ( 𠂊 ) followed by something from behind ( ㇏ ) – to approach from behind. However, none of Xu Shen's interpretations are based on oracle bones and Zhou bronzes.
Unrelated to 冬 , in which the top component represents a rope with a knot on top (today 終 ). Also unrelated to 散 despite meaning "to walk".
Pictogram ( 象形 ) – the knot at the end of a rope; ancient form of 終 ("[to] end").
