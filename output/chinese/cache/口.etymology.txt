[口]
Pictogram ( 象形 ) – resembles an open mouth.
In the oracle bone script, radical 口 is used for characters having abstract meanings. Such a character can have a figurative meaning derived from the phonetic part, e.g. 右 ( OC *ɢʷɯʔ, *ɢʷɯs , “right”) = 又 ( OC *ɢʷɯs , “right hand”) + 口 and 𪪺 (“strong; powerful”) = 弓 ( OC *kʷɯŋ , “bow”) + 口 , or be an unrelated borrowing, e.g. 否 ( OC *brɯʔ, *pɯʔ , “no”) = 不 ( OC *pɯ, *pɯʔ, *pɯ' , “calyx”) + 口 .
