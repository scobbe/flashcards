    "description": "水(水) (shuǐ, \"water\") + 蕭(萧) (xiāo, \"rustling sound/ph) = clear water characteristics -> deep and clear water",
    "interpretation": "The character 潇 (瀟) combines 水(水) (shuǐ, \"water\") for its semantic component, indicating a relationship with water, with the phonetic 蕭(萧) (xiāo, \"rustling sound/ph)\" to convey the sound of flowing water. This reflects the ideas of clarity and briskness associated with moving water.",
    "simplification": "The character 潇 is the simplified form of 瀟, retaining the semantic 水(水) (shuǐ, \"water\") component while simplifying the complex 蕭(萧) (xiāo, \"rustling sound/ph)\" component by replacing it with the simpler 萧(萧) (xiāo, \"rustling sound/ph)\", retaining its phonetic properties."
