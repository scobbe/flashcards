    "description": "言 (“word”) with something in 口 (“mouth”) written like 甘—sound coming from the mouth; the vertical ‘tongue’ stroke later disappeared, and 甘 was stylized as 曰.",
    "interpretation": "Speech (言) is combined with a mouth (口), originally with an inner stroke depicting the tongue, to depict sound emerging from the mouth. Over time the inner 甘 element evolved into 曰 and the tongue stroke was dropped, yielding the modern form.",
