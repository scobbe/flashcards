[喬]
Ideogram ( 指事 ) – a differentiated form ( 分化字 ) of 高 ( OC *kaːw , “high, tall”), with a differentiating marker, which was variously a stroke, 屮 , 止 , 力 , 九 , or 夭 .
Based on the 夭 form, only attested starting from the Han dynasty ( Chi, 2010 ), Shuowen erroneously interprets 夭 as a semantic component meaning “to bend” and treats the character as a phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 ).
