[天]
A horizontal line above a man with outstretched arms 大 to indicate the sky (compare the original versions of 上 ). The other ancient representations of the character depicted a man with a large squared head, an anthropomorphic representation of heaven.
Original meaning of the word is “sky”. Such concept is difficult to depict with a pictogram, hence the current form. Perhaps influenced by the glyph, the character was frequently glossed in Old Chinese documents with 顛 ( OC *tiːn, *tʰiːns , “crown of the head”), and such had led to incorrect hypotheses which regarded 天 ( OC *qʰl'iːn ) as a derivation of 顛 or 巔 ( OC *tiːn , “top of the head/hill”).

[夫]
Pictogram ( 象形 ): a variant form of 大 ( OC *daːds, *daːds ) preserving its original meaning of 夫 ( OC *pa , “man”). [ 1 ] 大 and 夫 were originally used interchangeably before settling to their current meanings. [ 2 ]
The character was later also phonetically borrowed as an instance of jiajie ( 假借 ) for 夫 ( OC *ba , “that”).
Shuowen mistakes the added horizontal stroke for a hairpin. In ancient times, when men reached the age of 20, they bound their hair with a hairpin during the Guan Li ceremony . The hairpin would thus be interpreted as the sign of “a grownup man”.
