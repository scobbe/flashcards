Pictogram ( 象形 ) – a bag or basket , borrowed for phonetic value. Compare 東 ( OC *toːŋ , “bundle > east”), 束 and 鹵 . Traditionally explained as a pictogram of a bird settling into its nest, which by analogy with the setting of the sun means “west”. This etymology has been disputed ( Sears ), but Sagart (2004) stands by it.
See also the top component of 票 , originally two hands holding an object vaguely similar to a bag, basket or nest.
