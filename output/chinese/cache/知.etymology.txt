Originally the same character as 智 , used interchangeably. In oracle bone inscriptions , ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 大 ( “ adult ” ) + 口 ( “ mouth ” ) + 子 ( “ child ” ) – to transmit knowledge. In the Warring States period, 大 corrupted into 矢 ( OC *hliʔ ) and became a sound component. In Western Han script the component 子 started being dropped, arriving at the modern form.
