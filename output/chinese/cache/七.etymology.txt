Pictogram ( 象形 ) – a vertical stroke and a horizontal stroke bisecting each other – original character of 切 ( OC *sn̥ʰiːds, *sn̥ʰiːd , “to cut”). ( Can this ( + ) etymology be sourced ?)
The top-most horizontal stroke is done from left to right. The vertical stroke and bottom-most horizontal stroke are done as one stroke, from top-left to bottom-right.
