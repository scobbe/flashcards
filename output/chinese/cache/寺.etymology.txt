Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *ljɯs ): phonetic 𡳿 ( OC *tjɯ , “ to go ” ) + semantic 又 ( “ hand ” ) – to grasp, to hold. Phonetic 𡳿 ( 之 ), which represents a footprint pointing up, became 土 or 士 in the clerical script from the late Western Han to the Eastern Han, and semantic 又 become 寸 in Small Seal Script. The derivative 持 ( OC *l'ɯ ) refers to the original word.
The character was often used in the place of a more specialized form. For example, in the Chu Silk Manuscript (see table above) it clearly stood for 時 ( OC *djɯ , “season”).
