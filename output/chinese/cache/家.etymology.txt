Oracle bone script: Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *kraː ): semantic 宀 ( “ roof ” ) + phonetic 𢑓 ( xiá , “ male pig ” ) . [ 1 ] An archaic variant closer to the original drawing is 𡩀 . See 𢑓 ( xiá ) for more. Similar to 冡 .
Later the phonetic component have been corrupted to 豕, so Shuowen Jiezi erroneously analyzed it as Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *kraː ): semantic 宀 ( “ roof ” ) + abbreviated phonetic 豭 ( OC *kraː , “ pig ” ) .
All etymologies based on the modern version of the phonetic component (豕) are folk etymologies since they miss the original component (𢑓).
