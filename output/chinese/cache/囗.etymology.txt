[囗]
Pictogram of a square-shaped enclosure. Unrelated to 口 (open mouth) and most likely unrelated to the original version of 丁 (head of a nail). Also unrelated to 因 , in which it represents a carpet or mat.

[圍]
Originally written as 韋 (“to surround”). Now phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *ɢʷɯl, *ɢʷɯls ): semantic 囗 ( “ enclosure ” ) + phonetic 韋 ( OC *ɢʷɯl ) .

[围]
Simplified from 圍 ( 韋 → 韦 ).
