[卄]
variant form of 廿

[廿]
Two 十 ("ten") written side by side, with a horizontal stroke at the bottom that fuses them. See also 卅 .
In characters such as 漢 and 黄 , it represents an open mouth 口 , while in 度 and 席 it actually represents a stylized rock 石 .

[廾]
Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 𠂇 ( “ left hand ” ) + 又 ( “ right hand ” ) – both hands. Also written 𠬞 .
Often stylized as 八 at the bottom of a character, e.g., 兵 , 共 , 具 , and 兴 (which however is unrelated to the legs of a table in 其 , 真 , and 典 ). See also the top component of 學 . Eventually, see the top component of 泰 , 奉 , 奏 , and 秦 in their original version.
Slightly conservative variant of 廿 ( niàn ) .

[拱]
Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ) and phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *kloŋʔ ): semantic 扌 ( “ hand ” ) + phonetic 共 ( OC *kloŋ, *ɡloŋs ) .
