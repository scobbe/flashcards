    "description": "木(木) (mù, \"tree\") + 婁(婁) (lóu, phonetic) = wooden structure -> large building -> 樓(樓) (lóu, \"tower\")",
    "interpretation": "The character 樓(樓) (lóu, \"tower\") combines the semantic 木(木) (mù, \"tree\") signifying wooden structures and the phonetic 婁(婁) (lóu) to suggest a large wooden building. This compound character conveys the image of a building with multiple floors, typically incorporating timber in its construction.",
    "simplification": "樓(樓) was simplified to 楼(楼) by replacing 婁(婁) with 娄(娄), which retains the phonetic component but reduces the number of strokes."
