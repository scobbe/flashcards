[參]
Simplified from 曑 ( 晶 → 厽 ).
The bronze script form is an ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 晶 ( “ stars ” ) + 光 ( “ light; brightness ” ) + 彡 ( “ light rays ” ) – Three Stars mansion. 彡 ( OC *sroːm, *slom ) also acts as a phonetic component. Ignoring the lines connecting the three stars, 光 may be interpreted as 卩 (“kneeling person”), representing someone looking at the shining stars above him.
Alternatively, it may be the original character of 簪 ( OC *ʔsɯːm, *ʔsrɯm , “hairpin”), since the bronze script forms resemble a person wearing a hat with three stars.
Based on the seal script form, Shuowen interprets the character as a phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *sʰluːm, *sʰluːms, *sloːm, *sʰrum, *srum ): semantic 晶 ( “ stars ” ) + phonetic 㐱 . However, according to the original form, this character is unrelated to 㐱 .

[摻]
Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *sruːm, *sruːmʔ ): semantic 手 + phonetic 參 ( OC *sʰluːm, *sʰluːms, *sloːm, *sʰrum, *srum ) .
