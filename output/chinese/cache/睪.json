    "interpretation": "Combines an eye with a fetter/constraint image, evoking the idea of looking intently or selecting by sight. Earlier bronze forms showed shackled hands and later added an eye; the current form preserves 目 with 㚔 as a purely semantic pairing. The graph was later also used as a variant for 睾 in the anatomical term for testicles.",
