  "simplified": "阳",
  "traditional": "陽",

  "english": "yang; male; sunny/bright; south side of a mountain",
  "etymology": {
    "type": "Phono-semantic compound (形聲/形声)",
    "description": "semantic: 阜 (hill) + phonetic: 昜 (sunshine); 昜 was original, 阜 added later.",
    "interpretation": "阜 evokes a hillside, hinting at the sense of the sunny/southern slope and brightness. 昜 supplies the yáng sound while also reinforcing the notion of rising light; in the simplified form, 日 keeps the sun/brightness idea even though the original phonetic is replaced.",
    "simplification": "Simplified from 陽 by replacing 昜 with 日 (i.e., 昜 → 日), an attested unorthodox variant later standardized in 1956 to reduce strokes."
