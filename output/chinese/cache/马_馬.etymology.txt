[馬]
Pictogram ( 象形 ) – a horse with its head facing the left, showing a flowing mane in the wind. In the bronze inscriptions, the head was often simplified into an eye ( 目 ( mù ) ). The legs eventually evolved into four dots ( 灬 ( huǒ ) , unrelated to 火 ( huǒ ) ).
Contrast with 鹿 ( lù , “ deer ” ) , which saw a very different development, and 𢊁 (as in 薦 / 荐 ( jiàn ) ), which is a hybrid: it has the legs of 馬 ( 灬 ( huǒ ) ) but the head of 鹿 ( lù ) .
