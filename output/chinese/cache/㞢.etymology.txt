[㞢] an ancient form of 有.

[有]
Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *ɢʷɯʔ ): phonetic 又 ( OC *ɢʷɯs ) + semantic 肉 ( “ meat ” ) . The hand shape has been abstracted to 𠂇 ; compare 右 , where 又 has also taken this shape. The 肉 in turn has taken the form of ⺼ .
The character may have been the original form of 侑 ( OC *ɢʷɯs , “to urge to eat”). Alternatively, it may be the original form of 醢 ( OC *qʰɯːʔ , “minced pickled meat”), which also has the 又 ( OC *ɢʷɯs ) element as phonetic.
Folk etymology traditionally explains it as a hand holding meat, hence “in possession of”. However, the oracle bone script shows no meat.
Shuowen Jiezi and other ancient sources have erroneously analyzed the character as a phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *ɢʷɯʔ ): phonetic 又 ( OC *ɢʷɯs ) + semantic 月 ( “ moon ” ) . Shuowen Jiezi defines 有 as " 不宜有也 " ("[to have something that] not should be had"), citing the Spring and Autumn Annals ( 春秋傳 ): " 日月有食之 " ("There are solar and lunar eclipses"). As eclipses were not auspicious to the Chinese, they were "something that should not be happening". The 月 component alludes to the inauspicious lunar eclipse.

[肴] simplified and variant traditional form of 餚.
