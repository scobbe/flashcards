[幸]
Two kinds of glyph are found in Warring States era:
A compound of 犬 at left + 羊 at right.
• Dog and sheep are seen to bring luck ( Zhao, 1999 ).
• 羊 ( *laŋ ) is phonetic ( Liu, 2022 ).
A compound of upside-down 矢 at left + 犬 at right, with unknown intention ( Chen, 2005 ).
Qin-Han dynasty era inherited the Sanjin glyph with 犬 at top and 羊 at bottom ( Liu, 2022 ). This is the source of the contemporary 幸 ( Chen, 2015 ).
Shuo Wen interpreted it as a compound of 屰 ( “ opposite ” ) + 夭 ( “ death ” ) – lucky to be alive; fortunate.
