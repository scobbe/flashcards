    "type": "phono-semantic compound (originally ideogrammic compound)",
    "description": "semantic: 貝 (“valuables; gifts”) + phonetic: 𡧍 ≈ 丏; oracle form was 宀 + 人, with 貝 added in bronze script.",
    "interpretation": "Depicts a person under a roof, indicating someone lodging as a guest; shells/money later highlighted the custom of bringing gifts. In the standardized analysis, 貝 supplies the meaning of valuables while the sound was taken from the 丏-type element.",
    "simplification": "In Simplified Chinese 賓 → 宾; the 貝 component was removed and the lower phonetic element was regularized, reducing strokes while keeping the ‘roof/guest’ idea."
