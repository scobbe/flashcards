[干]
Pictogram ( 象形 ) of a shield with feather ornaments on top; in some versions in oracle bones, the central and flat part of the shield can be seen as 回 .
As an alternative, it is possible 干 and 單 are variant forms of the same character in oracle bone script due to their similar shapes and its appearance in the original forms of 敢 . Hence, 干 would depict a bifurcated hunting weapon, not a shield. But 單 has two dots on top that depict two stones, while these two dots are absent in 干.
Also borrowed phonetically as a simplification of 乾 (dry) and 幹 . See also 盾 (the pictogram of another shield) and its possible differentiation 古 .
The interpretation that links this pictogram to a pestle is folk etymology. Unrelated to 午 , which however represents a pestle.
