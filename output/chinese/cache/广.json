    "type": "pictogram",
    "description": "Pictogram: a house with a roof, a building with three walls (cf. 宀 with four); unrelated to 床, 疒, or ⼚.",
    "interpretation": "Originally depicted a simple shelter or building, evoking the idea of coverage or expanse under a roof. Later it served as the semantic ‘building/space’ element in 廣, whose phonetic is 黃, while the simplified form keeps the pictographic outline and associates with the sense ‘broad, wide’.",
    "simplification": "Simplified by reducing 廣 to its semantic component 广 and dropping the complex phonetic 黃, retaining the roof-and-wall pictographic form."
