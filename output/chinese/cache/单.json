    "description": "Pictogram of a Y-shaped wooden stick A + two stones attached on top B = weapon for hunting -> later stylized to resemble 口 (kǒu, 'mouth') resembling 中 (zhōng, 'middle') -> further stylized as 田 (tián, 'field') with additional horizontal stroke below -> final form 單(單).",
    "interpretation": "The character 單(單) intuitively represents a hunting tool or weapon, emphasizing its initial function and eventual simplification and stylization over time. The component 单 in this case represents a simplified form, which might have been used for practical writing needs.",
    "simplification": "單(單) was simplified to 单 by eliminating additional strokes, creating a more straightforward representation that aligns with modern writing practices."
