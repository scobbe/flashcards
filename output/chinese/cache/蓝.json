    "interpretation": "Grass radical points to a plant, aligning with the indigo plant used to make blue dye. 監 provides the sound, and its simplified form 监 preserves the phonetic cue while reducing strokes.",
    "simplification": "The phonetic component 監 was simplified to 监 to reduce stroke count and align with the general simplification of 監→监, while keeping the grass semantic."
