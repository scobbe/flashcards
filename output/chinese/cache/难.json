    "type": "phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "semantic: 隹 (‘bird’) + phonetic: 暵 (abbreviated); later phonetically borrowed for other senses.",
    "interpretation": "隹 contributes the idea of a bird, reflecting that 難 originally named a kind of bird, while the element from 暵 provided the sound nán. The word was later borrowed to express the sense ‘difficult’, and modern 难 is the simplified graphic form of that earlier character.",
    "simplification": "Stroke reduction by replacing the complex left component of 難 with 又, an unorthodox variant recorded since the Ming; proposed in ROC’s 1935 list (retracted 1936) and officially adopted by the PRC in 1956."
