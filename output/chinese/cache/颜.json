    "description": "semantic: 頁(頁) (yè, 'leaf, page') + phonetic: 彥(彥) (yàn, 'accomplished person') -> 顏(顏, 'face')",
    "interpretation": "The traditional character 顏(顏) (yán, 'face, countenance') combines 頁(頁) (yè, 'leaf, page') as the semantic component, representing the face, with 彥(彥) (yàn, 'accomplished person') for its phonetic value, suggesting a distinguished appearance or expression. The elements relate to physical presence and facial expression.",
    "simplification": "The traditional components were simplified: 彥(彥) (yàn, 'accomplished person') was simplified to 彦(彦) and 頁(頁) (yè, 'leaf, page') was simplified to 页(页), maintaining three of the original lines for resemblance."
