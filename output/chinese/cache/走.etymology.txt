[走]
Pictogram ( 象形 ): a running man. An additional 止 (“foot”) was added later. The variant form 𧺆 preserves the form in the Small Seal Script.
In the modern form, the top component ( 夭 ) is simplified to the unrelated 土 and the bottom part is stylized as 龰 . See also the top component of 去 and 赤 .
As with 圭 , there are two separate vertical strokes, not a single one.
