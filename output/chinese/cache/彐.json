    "interpretation": "The character 彐(jì, 'snout') is a pictogram that resembles a hand grasping an object, with its fingers represented by three lines. While originally a variant of 彑, depicting a pig's snout, in many characters, it’s simplified to symbolize a hand, often portrayed with three fingers. This visual stylization captures the essence of the hand in a simplified form, commonly seen in various characters.",
