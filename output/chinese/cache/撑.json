    "description": "semantic: 手 (“hand”) + phonetic: 牚 (OC *rtʰaːŋs)",
    "interpretation": "The hand element indicates a manual action such as holding or propping something up. The phonetic 牚 supplies the pronunciation cheng and also historically relates to the idea of propping or supporting, reinforcing the meaning.",
    "simplification": "The traditional right-side phonetic 牚 was replaced by a streamlined form in 撑, reducing strokes while preserving the left-hand semantic 扌 and the pronunciation chēng."
