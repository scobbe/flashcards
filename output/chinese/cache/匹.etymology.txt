Uncertain. Various theories have been proposed based on the evidence from the bronze inscriptions:
Shuowen considers it to be an ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ) and phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *pʰid ): phonetic 八 ( OC *preːd , “ eight ” ) + semantic 匸 ( “ to conceal ” ) – unit of measuring cloth. 八 refers to eight folds in one 匹 of cloth (two bolts of cloth), and 匸 refers to concealing the two ends of the cloth when rolling it up. This interpretation is not likely since the older forms evidently do not contain these components.
