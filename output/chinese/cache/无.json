    "description": "Origin unknown; probably an ancient variant of 元/天/堯; historically used interchangeably with 無 and readopted by the PRC in 1956; not to be confused with 旡.",
    "interpretation": "Meaning 'not/without' was shared with 無 in early texts, and the simpler graph 无 was revived and standardized in the PRC. Its graphic ancestry is uncertain—possibly linked to 元, 天, or 堯—so it is best viewed as an old variant rather than a regular semantic–phonetic formation.",
    "simplification": "Adopted a historical variant with fewer strokes (无) to replace 無 in 1956; variant-based stroke reduction rather than structural simplification."
