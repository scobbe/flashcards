    "description": "The character 无 was one among several historical representations for expressing 'no' or 'not any,' used alongside 無(無) (wú, 'not have') and 亡(亡) (wáng, 'to lose'), especially during the Warring States period. The origin of 无 is uncertain, and it might have evolved as a variant of other characters like 元(元) (yuán, 'origin'), 天(天) (tiān, 'heaven'), or 堯(堯) (yáo, 'legendary ruler'). Adopted officially in simplified script in 1956 by the PRC.",
    "interpretation": "Without a clear etymology, the character 无 represents a reduction and simplification that was standardized in modern times to denote the concept of absence or non-existence.",
    "simplification": "无 is a simplified form adopted in 1956 to unify and clarify usage from various historical forms representing negation."
