    "description": "phonetic 殸 + semantic 耳 (‘ear’).",
    "interpretation": "Combines 耳 “ear,” signaling a meaning related to hearing, with 殸 as the sound component guiding pronunciation. The graphic thus links the idea of hearing with a phonetic cue from the 殸 series, yielding the sense of sound/voice.",
    "simplification": "In simplification, the semantic ear 耳 was dropped and the graph was streamlined by adopting a reduced form of the phonetic component, yielding 声 with fewer strokes."
