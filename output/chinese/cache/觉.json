    "type": "phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "semantic: 見 “see” + phonetic: 𦥯; simplified as 𦥯→𰃮 and 見→见.",
    "interpretation": "Combines the meaning of “seeing/perceiving” with a sound-bearing component, yielding the idea of perceiving or becoming aware. The phonetic 𦥯 guides the pronunciation, while 見 anchors the sense of perception.",
    "simplification": "Both components were graphically simplified to reduce strokes and standardize forms: phonetic 𦥯 to 𰃮 and semantic 見 to 见, aligning with Mainland script reform for ease of writing."
