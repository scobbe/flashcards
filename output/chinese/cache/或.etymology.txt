Pictogram ( 象形 ): a kind of axe. Phonetically borrowed for abstract meanings. The blade of the axe eventually separated into 口 . [ 1 ]
The corrupted form, together with it being used to represent 域 ( OC *ɢʷrɯɡ , “territory”), lead Shuowen to mistake it as a compound of 戈 (“ dagger-axe (used to defend the territory)”) + 囗 (“city wall”) + 一 , “territory”.
