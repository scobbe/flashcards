[或]
Pictogram ( 象形 ): a kind of axe. Phonetically borrowed for abstract meanings. The blade of the axe eventually separated into 口 . [ 1 ]
The corrupted form, together with it being used to represent 域 ( OC *ɢʷrɯɡ , “territory”), lead Shuowen to mistake it as a compound of 戈 (“ dagger-axe (used to defend the territory)”) + 囗 (“city wall”) + 一 , “territory”.

[咸]
Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 戌 ( “ ax ” ) + 口 — to terminate. The 口 is a distinguishing mark. Later borrowed to mean "all". [ 字源 1 ]
Other explanations include shouting together with a spear in front of the battlefield, implying everyone; alternatively, to cut off one's head with an ax, depriving them of all they have; alternatively, to break a pot with an ax.
For etymology 2, simplified from 鹹 (elimination of 鹵 ).
