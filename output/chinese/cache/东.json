  "etymology": {
    "type": "rebus (phonetic loan) and ideogram; alternatively pictogram",
    "description": "Loan: 束 or 橐 used for the sound 東, with an added horizontal stroke to distinguish it from 束; alternatively a pictogram of a tied bundle/bag.",
    "interpretation": "Originally a phonetic loan from characters like 束/橐, later marked with an extra stroke to keep it distinct from 束 as the meaning ‘east’ solidified. The popular ‘sun behind a tree’ analysis (日 + 木) is a later folk reading and not supported by the earliest forms.",
    "simplification": "Adopted the running/cursive-script abbreviation of 東 to create 东, reducing strokes for easier, faster writing (cf. 車→车)."
