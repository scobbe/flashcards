    "description": "Originally a pictogram of a bundle; simplified to 东 (dōng, \"east\") in cursive, mirroring 車 (chē, \"vehicle\") to 车",
    "interpretation": "The character 東 originally depicted a bundle of objects tied together, visually symbolizing the concept of 'east' through its form. As writing evolved, the character was simplified to 东, following a similar reduction from 車 to 车. This simplification focused on retaining core visual elements while removing complexity.",
    "simplification": "The simplification from 東 to 东 involved a reduction to a cursive shorthand form, parallel to 車 becoming 车."
