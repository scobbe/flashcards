[两]
simplified and variant form of 兩

[兩]
According to Shuowen Jiezi an ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 一 + 㒳 .
Baxter (1992) observes that, in historical forms, the character is two 丙 ( OC * praŋʔ ) joined together; this would make 丙 the phonetic component in a sort of phono-ideogrammic compound (see also Baxter & Sagart (2014) ).
The character could be linked to the original form of 更 , which represents two chariots and a whip.
