    "description": "a skein of silk.",
    "interpretation": "Depicts a bundle of silk threads tied in the middle, with strands hanging above and below. The stylized sketch highlights twisted filaments, which later served as the standard radical for thread- and textile-related characters.",
    "simplification": "In Simplified Chinese the silk radical was streamlined to 纟 to reduce strokes and speed writing; 糸 is rarely used independently, but 纟 replaces it as a left-side component."
