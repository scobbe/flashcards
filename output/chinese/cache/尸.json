  "etymology": {
    "type": "pictogram",
    "description": "Pictogram: a human figure with bent legs, side facing front; ancient form 𡰣, interpreted as sitting or lying. (Trad. 屍 is phono-semantic: phonetic 尸 + semantic 死.)",
    "interpretation": "Evokes a human body in profile with bent legs, suggesting someone seated or lying down, which aligns with the sense of a corpse or body. In the traditional form 屍, 死 reinforces the meaning ‘death’ while 尸 supplies the sound and body-related imagery.",
    "simplification": "屍 → 尸 by dropping the semantic 死 and keeping the base 尸, reducing strokes and aligning with the long-used radical form; meaning remained clear from context."
