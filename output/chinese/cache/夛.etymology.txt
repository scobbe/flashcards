[夛]
an ancient form of 多

[多]
Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ) – two pieces of meat ( 肉 ). In the bronze script, 肉 was corrupted into 夕 due to visual similarity, making 多 into a duplication of 夕 . The form with 夕 was inherited in later scripts.
Chi (2010) suggests that meat is scarce in ancient times, so two pieces of meat is a lot, citing a passage from Mencius :
Chang Ping-chuan suggests that it is the duplicative nature of the character that gives the meaning of "many", just like in 林 (“forest”), from 木 (“tree; wood”).
