[午]
Pictogram ( 象形 ) – a pestle (now written 杵 ). Unrelated to 干 . See the central component of 舂 and 秦 in their original version.

[舞]
Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *maʔ ): abbreviated phonetic 無 ( OC *ma ) + semantic 舛 ( “ steps, feet in convergent direction ” ) . This character was coined to preserve the original meaning of 無 , which is "dancing"; hence, the upper component also adds part of the meaning. A conservative variant is 𦨅 .
