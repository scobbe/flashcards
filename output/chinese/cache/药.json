    "interpretation": "藥(藥) (yào, \"medicine\") combines the semantic 艹(艹) (cǎo, \"grass\"), reflecting the use of plants in remedies, with the phonetic 樂(樂) (lè, \"music\"), indicating the sound element of the original character. This construction signifies plant-derived compounds for healing.",
    "simplification": "藥(藥) was first simplified by the Republic of China as 葯(葯) with intended phonetic alignment, and later as 药(藥) in the People's Republic of China by replacing 樂(樂) with 乐(乐) (lè, \"joy\"), further simplified to 药(藥) using 约(约) (yuē, \"agreement\") for phonetic simplicity."
