    "type": "phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "semantic: 艹 (“grass”) + phonetic: 樂 (OC *ŋraːwɢs, *raːwɢ, *ŋraːwɢ)",
    "interpretation": "药 is a phono-semantic compound where the component 艹 suggests that it relates to plants or herbs, typical for many characters associated with medicine or drugs. The phonetic component 樂 contributes to the pronunciation. This implies that traditional Chinese medicine heavily revolves around herbal remedies, capturing the essence of ancient medical practices.",
    "simplification": "The character was simplified to reduce the number of strokes, making it easier to write. The phonetic component 樂 was replaced by simpler characters in interim reforms before settling on 药."
