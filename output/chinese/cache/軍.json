  "etymology": {
    "type": "phono-semantic compound",
    "description": "semantic 車 (“chariot”) + phonetic (original form of 螾; not 勹). Shuowen: ideogrammic 車 + 勹 (“to surround”).",
    "interpretation": "Built on 車 to evoke warfare/vehicles, paired with a phonetic element whose lineage (cf. 螾, 旬, 勻, 云) points to an early -un/-win sound that developed into jūn. Later graphic evolution made it look like 勹 was the phonetic, which also inspired the Shuowen’s ideogrammic reading of ‘cart + wrapping/surrounding’.",
    "simplification": "Simplified to 军 by adopting a long-used clerical/cursive variant that streamlines and compresses the 車 component; this shorthand was standardized in the PRC simplification."
