[酉]
Pictogram ( 象形 ) – a wine vessel with a pointed bottom.
This is the original character for 酒 ( jiǔ , “alcohol”).
Compare 酋 ( qiú ) (the vessel with added strokes indicating long-fermented alcohol or decoration) and 尊 ( zūn ) (two hands holding the vessel).
Visually similar to but etymologically unrelated to 西 ( xī ) (which originally depicted a bird's nest).
