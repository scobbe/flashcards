In oracle bone script, ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 皀 ( “ food vessel ” ) + 夊 ( “ downward foot ” ) – to leave the table after eating. Variants that depicted the vessel as 酉 or 豆 were common. Bronze inscriptions added 彳 to emphasize the action of walking away.
In the modern form the vessel 皀 has simplified to the unrelated 艮 , similar to ⾷ , 即 , 既 , 郷 .
Shuowen misinterprets the seal script form as ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 彳 ( “ move ” ) + 夊 ( “ walk ” ) + 日 ( “ sun ” ) – to walk away from the sun, to retreat.
