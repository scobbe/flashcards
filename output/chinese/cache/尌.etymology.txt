[尌]
Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 木 ( “ tree ” ) + 寸 ( “ hand ” ) — to plant a tree. The form in the oracle bone script appears as 权 . A phonetic 豆 ( OC *doːs ) was added later.
In the modern form, 木 and 豆 have fused into 壴 , and the character is sometimes mistaken for a compound of 壴 + 寸 ;.
This character has largely been superseded by 樹 ( OC *djoʔ, *djos ).

[樹]

[树]
Simplified from 樹 ( 壴 → 又 )
