    "interpretation": "The word 上班(上班) (shàngbān, \"to go to work\") combines the idea of attending, as in 上(上) (shàng, \"to go upward; to attend\"), with a work shift or duty, as indicated by 班(班) (bān, \"shift; duty\"). Thus, it literally means to attend one's duty or work shift, which is understood as going to work.",
