    "interpretation": "Combines the sense of a path or way (行) with the sound value carried by 朮, yielding the idea of methods and techniques. In the simplified form 术, the phonetic element remains while the path component is omitted, but the notion of a ‘way/technique’ is retained.",
    "simplification": "Simplified by dropping the semantic 行 from 術 and reducing 朮 to 术, preserving the phonetic element; 术 also serves as the simplified form of 朮."
