    "type": "ideogrammic compound (會意)",
    "description": "semantic: 舛 + 囗 — footsteps around an enclosure; later phonetic loan for “tanned leather”.",
    "interpretation": "Combines reversed footsteps with an enclosure to depict moving around or surrounding a boundary, a sense linked to 圍 ‘to surround’. The graph was later borrowed for the homophonous word wéi meaning “tanned leather,” so the leather sense is a phonetic loan unrelated to the original picture.",
    "simplification": "PRC simplification reduced 韋 to 韦 by compressing the enclosure-and-footstep strokes into a single streamlined form, enabling it to serve as a common simplified component."
