[縣]
Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): 目 + 木 + 糸 - to hang with the string 糸 by the head 目 (using an eye to represent a head) on a tree 木. Originally referred to 懸 ( OC *ɡʷeːn , “to hang”); later jiajie ( 假借 ) for 縣 ( OC *ɡʷeːn, *ɡʷeːns , “administrative division”).
In Qin bamboo slip scripts, some of 目 + 木 were corrupted to 県 (with one straight horizontal line rather than 𠃊 ) which interpreted to a reversed head 𥄉 by Shuowen , and 糸 was corrupted to 系 .

[县] simplified form of 縣.
