- **traditional:** 岡
- **simplified:** 冈
- **pronunciation:** gāng / gǎng
- **definition:** # sub-component
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 冈(岡)比亚(亞) (gāngbǐyà, "Gambia")
  - 冈(岡)峦(巒) (gāngluán, "mountain ridges")
  - 冈(岡)陵 (gānglíng, "ridges and hills")
- **etymology (岡):**
  - **type:** pictogram → phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** pictogram of 网(網) (wǎng, "net") → phono-semantic: phonetic: 网(網) (wǎng, "net") + semantic: 山 (shān, "mountain").
  - **interpretation:** Early graphs depict a net. In 岡, 网 serves as the phonetic while 山 supplies the semantic field of terrain, yielding the sense "mountain ridge"; the phonetic accounts for the modern readings gāng/gǎng. In Simplified Chinese, 冑 was not involved; rather, 冈 was adopted as the simplified form of 岡 for this meaning.
