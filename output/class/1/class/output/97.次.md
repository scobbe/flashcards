  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** pictogram: depiction of a person exhaling.
  - **interpretation:** It depicts a person exhaling, reflecting breath or a sigh. The graph later came to write the word meaning order/next and the classifier for occurrences, with the original pictographic sense no longer active. An alternative analysis in Shuowen treats it as phono-semantic with 二 (èr, "two") plus 欠 (qiàn, "yawn"), but early forms do not support this.
