  - 云(雲)冈(岡)石窟 (yún gāng shí kū, "Yungang Grottoes")
- **etymology (岡):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** phonetic: 网(網) (wǎng, "net") + semantic: 山 (shān, "mountain").
  - **interpretation:** The character combines 山 as the semantic determinative for mountains with 网 as the phonetic element indicating the sound near gāng. The mountain determinative anchors the meaning to terrain features, yielding the sense of a mountain ridge or crest.

    - 山

  - **simplification rule (冈):** 岡 was simplified to 冈 by replacing the complex net-and-mountain structure with a reduced form using 冂 and 㐅, reducing strokes through component replacement.
