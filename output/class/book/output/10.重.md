- **etymology (重):**
  - **type:** ideogrammic compound → phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** ideogrammic: 人 (rén, "man") + 东(東) (dōng, "bag") → ideogrammic: 人 (rén, "man") + 东(東) (dōng, "bag") + 土 (tǔ, "earth") → phono-semantic: semantic 人 (rén, "man") + phonetic 东(東) (dōng, "bag").
  - **interpretation:** It originally depicts a man carrying a bag, emphasizing a burden; adding 土 places the figure on the ground. In later analysis it functions as a phono-semantic character, with 人 conveying the semantic field of carrying/weight and 东 providing the sound, aligning with modern senses like “heavy” and “serious.”
