## to laugh; to smile
---
- **traditional:** 笑
- **simplified:** 笑
- **pronunciation:** xiào
- **definition:** to laugh; to smile
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 笑着(著) (xiào zhe, "smiling")
  - 笑容 (xiào róng, "smile")
  - 笑话(話) (xiào huà, "joke")
  - 开(開)玩笑 (kāi wán xiào, "make a joke")
- **etymology (笑):**
  - **type:** ideogrammic compound → phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** ideogrammic: 艹(艸) (cǎo, "grass") + 犬 (quǎn, "dog") → phono-semantic: semantic 竹 (zhú, "bamboo") + phonetic 夭 (yāo, "young").
  - **interpretation:** Early analysis treats the graph as either an ideogram combining 艹(艸) (cǎo, "grass") and 犬 (quǎn, "dog"), or a phonetic-semantic with 犬 as semantic and 艹(艸) as phonetic. Later it was regularized as a phono-semantic character with 竹 (zhú, "bamboo") as semantic determinative and 夭 (yāo, "young") as phonetic. Here 竹 functions mainly as a radical-classifier rather than literal meaning, while the phonetic 夭 aligns with the reading in modern xiào.
