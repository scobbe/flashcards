  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** pictogram of 俎 (zǔ, "sacrificial stand") → used for 祖 (zǔ, "ancestor") → later loan for the conjunction sense.
  - **interpretation:** It depicts a sacrificial stand used in offerings. Early on it wrote words tied to ancestor rites such as 祖 (zǔ, "ancestor") and 俎 (zǔ, "sacrificial stand"); some have instead seen a stone altar or even an erect phallus as the original picture. The modern conjunction meaning developed as a loan usage, possibly from a form cognate with 将(將) (jiāng, "will").
