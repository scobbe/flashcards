  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** pictogram: depiction of a wine vessel with a pointed bottom.
  - **interpretation:** It depicts a pointed-bottom wine vessel, giving the original sense ‘wine; wine vessel’. The graph was later borrowed as the tenth earthly branch, a calendrical use that persists today; any association with the rooster is secondary and possibly arbitrary. In mathematics, the ‘unitary’ sense is a modern loan from English.
