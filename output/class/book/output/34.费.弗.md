  - 自愧弗如 (zì kuì fú rú, "ashamed to be inferior")

- **etymology (弗):**
  - **type:** pictogram → phonetic loan
  - **description:** pictogram of 绳(繩) (shéng, "rope") + 木 (mù, "wood") + 木 (mù, "wood") → phonetic loan for 不 (bù, "not").
  - **interpretation:** It depicts a rope binding two pieces of wood to keep them straight. The graph was later borrowed for its sound to write the negator 不 (bù, "not"), unrelated to the original straightening sense, which was later written with 拂 (fú, "brush away/straighten"). In modern Chinese, 弗 mainly appears in transliterations and fixed phrases.
