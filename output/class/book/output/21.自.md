  - **type:** pictogram → phonetic borrowing
  - **description:** pictogram of 鼻 (bí, "nose") → phonetic borrowing: 自 (zì, "self; from").
  - **interpretation:** Depicts a human nose; this was the original sense and is preserved in 鼻. The graph was later borrowed for its sound to write the word 自 meaning “self; from,” and that meaning became standard. A folk explanation ties the sense to pointing at one’s nose to indicate oneself, but this is secondary.
