## spring
### sub-word
#### traditional music composition
---
- **traditional:** 春
- **simplified:** 春
- **pronunciation:** chūn
- **definition:** spring
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 春天 (chūntiān, "spring")
  - 春节(節) (chūnjié, "Spring Festival")
  - 春季 (chūnjì, "spring season")
  - 春风(風) (chūnfēng, "spring breeze")
- **etymology (春):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** semantic: 艹 (cǎo, "grass") + phonetic: 屯 (tún, "sprout") → semantic: 日 (rì, "sun") added to form 萅 (chūn, "spring") → 春.
  - **interpretation:** Built with the plant radical 艹 as the semantic and 屯 as the phonetic, evoking a sprout. Later 日 was added to emphasize growth under the sun, yielding the intermediate form 萅 that regularized as 春. Some sources note 春 alternated with 屯 for “spring” in early texts, but the plant-and-sun determinatives make the seasonal sense clear.
