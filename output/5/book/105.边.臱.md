- **traditional:** 臱
- **simplified:** 臱
- **pronunciation:** mián
- **definition:** sound
- **contemporary usage:**
  - None, not in contemporary use
- **etymology (臱):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** phono-semantic: 自 (zì, "since; from") + phonetic 丙 (bǐng, "third heavenly stem") → semantic: 方 (fāng, "side; direction") added → modern form with 丙 regularized to 穴 (xué, "cave").
  - **interpretation:** 自 acts as the semantic element indicating origin or direction, while 丙 provides the phonetic value yielding an OC reading like *men. The later addition of 方 ties the graph to the notion of side/direction, which aligns with its role as the original form of a border/edge graph; the replacement of 丙 by 穴 is a graphic corruption without semantic impact. Some sources also suggest 自 may have contributed phonetically via association with 鼻 as an alternative view.
