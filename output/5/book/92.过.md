## past; to pass
### sub-word
#### in or of the past
---
- **traditional:** 過
- **simplified:** 过
- **pronunciation:** guò
- **definition:** past; to pass
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 过(過)安检(檢) (guò ān jiǎn, "pass security check")
  - 过(過)期 (guò qī, "overdue")
  - 过(過)一遍 (guò yí biàn, "go over once")
  - 过(過)站 (guò zhàn, "ride past a stop")
- **etymology (過):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** semantic: 辶(辵) (chuò, "walk") + phonetic: 咼 (guō, "phonetic").
  - **interpretation:** The character combines the movement determinative 辶(辵) with the phonetic element 咼 to indicate the sound guo. The walking component aligns with senses of moving or passing by, which extend naturally to meanings like to pass, to cross, and to exceed.
  - **component characters:**
    - 辶(辵) (chuò, "walk")
    - 咼 (guō, "phonetic")
  - **reference:** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%81%8E
  - **simplification rule (过):** Replaced the right-side phonetic 咼 with 寸, reducing strokes and regularizing the form; this longstanding variant was standardized as the simplified 过.
