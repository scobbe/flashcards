  - **description:** pictogram: depiction of a stone altar → commonly used to write 祖 (zǔ, "ancestor") → later also interpreted as 俎 (zǔ, "sacrificial vessel").
  - **interpretation:** It depicts a stone altar or sacrificial stand. Early texts often used this graph for 祖 (zǔ, "ancestor"); some scholars instead see it as the sacrificial vessel 俎 (zǔ, "sacrificial vessel") or even a phallic symbol. The modern conjunction sense qiě arose from later borrowing of the graph for an unrelated function word, noted as cognate with 将(將) (jiāng, "be about to").
