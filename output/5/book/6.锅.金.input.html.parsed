金

Character forms: 金 U+91D1 , &#37329; CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-91D1 ← 釐 [U+91D0] CJK Unified Ideographs 釒 → [U+91D2] Glyph origin: Historical forms of the character 金 Western Zhou Shuowen Jiezi (compiled in Han ) Liushutong (compiled in Ming ) Bronze inscriptions Small seal script Transcribed ancient scripts Characters in the same phonetic series ( 金 ) ( Zhengzhang, 2003 ) Old Chinese 淦 *kɯːm, *kɯːms 顉 *ŋɯːmʔ, *ŋ̊ʰrɯm, *ŋ̊ʰɯmʔ 金 *krɯm 錦 *krɯmʔ 欽 *kʰrɯm 菳 *kʰrɯm 嶔 *kʰrɯm 撳 *kʰrɯms 捦 *ɡrɯm 鵭 *ɡrɯm 唫 *ɡrɯmʔ, *ŋɡrɯm 鈙 *ɡrɯms 崟 *ŋɡrɯm 趛 *ŋɡrɯmʔ Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *krɯm ): semantic 士 ( “ upside-down ritual axe perhaps made of precious materials ” ) + semantic 呂 ( “ two blocks of metal ” ) + phonetic 亼 ( OC *krɯm ) . The semantic component in folk etymology is very often misinterpreted as 王 . The blocks of metal were originally drawn as : and then as 丷 . The upper component 亼 is the ancient form for 今 ( OC *krɯm ) and it represents an open mouth flipped upside down; it indicates the original pronunciation of the whole character. Shuowen interprets it as an image of metal in the earth (Xu Shen writes "象金在土中形") with 亼 as phonetic. But the most ancient versions do not contain the pictogram of the earth. Originally referred to copper , first used during the Copper Age and the Jade Age in China (hence before the Bronze Age, during which the first bronzes were produced); later the meaning was extended to metal as a whole, and then to gold . Etymology: Starostin reconstructs Proto-Sino-Tibetan *gǝ̆m ( “ metal ” ) ; compare Tedim Chin xam ( “ gold ” ) and Lepcha ᰀᰩᰮ ( kóm , “ silver , coin , money ” ) . “ Copper ” [prior to 5th BCE ] → “metals in general” → “gold”. The main senses now are “gold” and “metal”. Some of the Manchu people with this surname are descendants of the Qing imperial family and is a calque of Manchu ᠠᡳᠰᡳᠨ ( aisin , “ gold ” ) in their original surname ᠠᡳᠰᡳᠨ ᡤᡳᠣᡵᠣ ( aisin gioro ) .
