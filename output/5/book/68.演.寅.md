#### to perform

- **traditional:** 寅
- **simplified:** 寅
- **pronunciation:** yín
- **definition:** third earthly branch
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 寅吃卯粮(糧) (yín chī mǎo liáng, "spend next month's income")
  - 寅时(時) (yín shí, "hours of the tiger")
  - 寅月 (yín yuè, "first lunar month")
  - 同寅 (tóng yín, "colleagues")
- **etymology (寅):**
  - **type:** ideogram
  - **description:** ideogram: 矢 (shǐ, "arrow") + 日 (rì, "sun") as distinguishing mark → modern form with 宀 (mián, "roof") as corrupted arrowhead.
  - **interpretation:** It depicts an arrow marked with a sign, later stylized so the arrowhead became the roof-like 宀. The graph was then used to denote the third Earthly Branch and associated Tiger period, a conventional calendrical use rather than a graphic one. Some scholars link its sound to a sense of drawing/stretching and to a waning half-moon phase, but these are later interpretations.
