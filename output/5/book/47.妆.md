- **traditional:** 妝
- **simplified:** 妆

- **etymology (妝):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** phono-semantic: phonetic 丬(爿) (qiáng, "plank") + semantic 女 (nǚ, "female").
  - **interpretation:** The character combines 女 as the semantic determinative indicating the domain of women and adornment with 丬(爿) as the phonetic, yielding the zhuāng sound seen across the 爿-series. The semantic 女 aligns with the modern sense of makeup and dressing up, while the phonetic component supplies the pronunciation.

    - 爿 (qiáng, "plank")
    - 女 (nǚ, "female")
  - **reference:** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%A6%9D
  - **simplification rule (妆):** Replaced the left phonetic component 爿 with its left-side variant 丬 to reduce strokes and regularize the form in left position.
