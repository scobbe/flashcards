  - **type:** phono-semantic compound

  - **interpretation:** A phono-semantic compound: 口 provides the semantic field of the mouth, while 冎 supplies the sound. The association with the mouth allows an early sense like “slanting/crooked” to be visualized as a mouth drawn askew, while other readings persist in proper-name or fixed usages.

  - **reference:** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%92%BC
  - **simplification rule (呙):** Simplified by replacing the complex phonetic 冎 with 内 and reconfiguring the structure as stacked 口 over 内, reducing strokes and regularizing it as a reusable component.
