- **traditional:** 舉
- **simplified:** 举
- **pronunciation:** jǔ
- **definition:** 
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 举(舉)行 (jǔ xíng, "hold an event")
  - 举(舉)例 (jǔ lì, "cite an example")
  - 举(舉)手之劳(勞) (jǔ shǒu zhī láo, "a small effort")
  - 举(舉)世闻(聞)名 (jǔ shì wén míng, "world-famous")
- **etymology (舉):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** phono-semantic: phonetic: 与(與) (yǔ, "and") + semantic: 手 (shǒu, "hand").
  - **interpretation:** It uses 与(與) (yǔ, "and") for sound and 手 (shǒu, "hand") for meaning, indicating a hand action of lifting or raising. This explains modern senses like raising something, holding ceremonies, or electing. Some analyses also relate it to 舁 (yú, "to lift") as a k-prefixed variant.
  - **component characters:**
    - 与(與) (yǔ, "and")
    - 手 (shǒu, "hand")
  - **reference:** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%88%89
  - **simplification rule (举):** Simplified by replacing the complex phonetic 與 with 兴 and by reducing the bottom 手 to the stylized component 𰀁, lowering stroke count and regularizing the structure.
