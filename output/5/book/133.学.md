## to study; learning
### sub-word
#### primary school
---
- **traditional:** 學
- **simplified:** 学
- **pronunciation:** xué
- **definition:** to study; learning
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 学(學)习(習) (xué xí, "to study")
  - 学(學)生 (xué shēng, "a student")
  - 学(學)校 (xué xiào, "a school")
  - 学(學)费(費) (xué fèi, "tuition fees")
- **etymology (學):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** phono-semantic: phonetic 爻 (yáo, "crossed lines") + phonetic 六 (liù, "six") → semantic: 子 (zǐ, "child") added → semantic: 冖 (mì, "cover") replaces 六.
  - **interpretation:** Originally the graph used 爻 (yáo, "crossed lines") and 六 (liù, "six") as phonetics, then added 子 (zǐ, "child") as a determinative to mark learning. Later forms regularized the top into 冖 (mì, "cover"), while 子 continued to signal the pedagogical domain, matching the modern senses of study and learning. An alternative analysis treats it as a semantic composition related to teaching under a roof, but early forms lack the child.
  - **component characters:**
    - 爻
    - 六
    - 子
    - 冖
  - **reference:** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%AD%B8
  - **simplification rule (学):** Simplified from 學 by replacing the complex top component 𦥯 with the streamlined 𰃮 and regularizing the old 六 into 冖, reducing strokes and easing handwriting.
