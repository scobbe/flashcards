- **etymology (食):**
  - **type:** pictogram → phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** pictogram: 亼 (jí, "mouth") over 皀 (jí, "bowl of rice") → phono-semantic: phonetic 亼 (jí, "mouth") + semantic 皀 (jí, "bowl of rice").
  - **interpretation:** Depicts a mouth over a bowl of rice on a stand, indicating eating and food. Later, Shuowen reinterpreted it as a phono-semantic graph with 亼 as the phonetic and 皀 as the semantic relating to food. The semantic element grounds the modern meanings of eating and food.
