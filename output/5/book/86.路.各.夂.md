- **pronunciation:** zhǐ
- **definition:** sole of foot
- **contemporary usage:**
  - None, not in contemporary use
- **etymology (夂):**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** pictogram: depiction of a footprint pointing downward.
  - **interpretation:** It depicts a footprint pointing downward, which naturally connects to the sense of stepping and thus ‘to approach from behind’. Shuowen alternatively analyzed it as an ideogram of two legs followed by something from behind, yielding the same meaning; it is unrelated to 冬 (dōng, "winter") or 散 (sàn, "scatter"). In later usage the same graph also served as an ancient form of 终(終) (zhōng, "end") and as a variant of 夊 (suī, "slow"), which are distinct from the original pictographic sense.
