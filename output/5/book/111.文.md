  - **description:** ideogram: depiction of a person with an emphasized chest tattoo indicating "pattern" → extension to "written glyph" → further abstraction to "literature" and "cultured".
  - **interpretation:** It depicts a person with a painted or tattooed chest, originally referring to a patterned mark or tattoo. As writing with ink came to be seen as patterned marks, the meaning shifted to written signs, then broadened to literature and refined culture. Schuessler also suggests it may derive with an -n suffix from 煤 (méi, "soot"), aligning with tattoos and ink.
