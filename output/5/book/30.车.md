#### to drive a car
---
- **traditional:** 車
- **simplified:** 车
- **pronunciation:** chē

- **etymology (車):**
  - **type:** pictogram
  - **description:** pictogram: depiction of a carriage seen from above with wheels and canopy → verticalized form with central 田 (tián, "field") marking the body → cursive streamlining in handwriting led to the simplified shape.
  - **interpretation:** It depicts a carriage seen from above, so it naturally came to denote wheeled vehicles. As writing rotated and regularized, the central platform was marked with 田, and later cursive reduction produced the simplified form used today.
  - **component characters:**
    - 田

  - **simplification rule (车):** Simplified by adopting a cursive-derived form with major stroke reduction, replacing the complex component 車 with the simpler 车 across characters.
