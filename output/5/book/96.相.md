---
- **traditional:** 相
- **simplified:** 相
- **pronunciation:** xiàng
- **definition:** image; appearance

- **etymology (相):**
  - **type:** ideogrammic compound
  - **description:** ideogrammic: 木 (mù, "tree") + 目 (mù, "eye") → 相 (xiàng, "to observe") → borrowed for 相 (xiāng, "mutually").
  - **interpretation:** It combines 目 “eye” and 木 “tree”, depicting an eye viewing a tree, hence the original sense “to observe.” The same graph was later borrowed to write an unrelated morpheme meaning “mutually.” The modern senses like “appearance/image” extend from what is seen and judged by observation.
