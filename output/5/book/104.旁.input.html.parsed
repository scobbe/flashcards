Character forms: 旁 U+65C1 , &#26049; CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-65C1 ← 旀 [U+65C0] CJK Unified Ideographs 旂 → [U+65C2] Glyph origin: Historical forms of the character 旁 Shang Western Zhou Spring and Autumn Warring States Oracle bone script Bronze inscriptions Bronze inscriptions Chu slip and silk script Qin slip script Characters in the same phonetic series ( 方 ) ( Zhengzhang, 2003 ) Old Chinese 縍 *paːŋ 榜 *paːŋʔ, *praːŋs, *braːŋ 蒡 *paːŋʔ, *braːŋ 牓 *paːŋʔ 螃 *paːŋʔ, *paːŋs, *baːŋ 搒 *paːŋs, *braːŋ 舫 *paːŋs, *paŋs 謗 *paːŋs 雱 *pʰaːŋ 磅 *pʰaːŋ, *pʰraːŋ 霶 *pʰaːŋ 滂 *pʰaːŋ 鎊 *pʰaːŋ 髈 *pʰaːŋʔ, *baːŋ 彷 *baːŋ, *pʰaŋʔ 趽 *baːŋ, *paŋ, *paŋs 房 *baːŋ, *baŋ 篣 *baːŋ, *braːŋ 騯 *baːŋ, *praːŋ, *braːŋ 傍 *baːŋ, *baːŋs 膀 *baːŋ 旁 *baːŋ 徬 *baːŋs 閍 *praːŋ 祊 *praːŋ 嗙 *praːŋ 方 *paŋ, *baŋ 汸 *paŋ 坊 *paŋ, *baŋ 邡 *paŋ, *pʰaŋs 枋 *paŋ 鈁 *paŋ 蚄 *paŋ 肪 *paŋ, *baŋ 鴋 *paŋ, *baŋ 牥 *paŋ 昉 *paŋʔ 瓬 *paŋʔ 放 *paŋʔ, *paŋs 倣 *paŋʔ 芳 *pʰaŋ 淓 *pʰaŋ 妨 *pʰaŋ, *pʰaŋs 紡 *pʰaŋʔ 仿 *pʰaŋʔ 髣 *pʰaŋʔ 鶭 *pʰaŋʔ 訪 *pʰaŋs 防 *baŋ, *baŋs 魴 *baŋ Probably phono-semantic ( 形聲 / 形声 ) following the pronunciation of 方 ( OC *paŋ, *baŋ ). The upper component, which perhaps indicates the semantic field, is unclear and has evolved significantly in time, including 冖 ( Shang ), 凡 ( Western Zhou ), or forms resembling 辛 ( Spring and Autumn bronze of Wu ) or 用 ( Warring States bronze inscription of Wei and proto- clerical script of Qin ). In the Chu Silk Manuscript the form was much simplified. The modern form was a descendant from the clerical script. Hence, a knife or chisel to mark prisoners 辛 is written above the phonetic component 方, perhaps to indicate the concept of moving to remote. However, as already stated, the semantic component in this character is unclear and evolved during time, hence more explanations linked to the earlier versions can be formulated. Etymology: Compare Tibetan བང ( bang , “ to run ” ) .
