- **traditional:** 金
- **simplified:** 金
- **pronunciation:** jīn
- **definition:** 
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 金属(屬) (jīnshǔ, "metal")
  - 金融 (jīnróng, "finance")
  - 金牌 (jīnpái, "gold medal")
  - 金价(價) (jīnjià, "gold price")
- **etymology (金):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** phono-semantic: semantic: 士 (shì, "ritual axe") + semantic: 吕(呂) (lǚ, "two blocks") + phonetic: 亼 (jí, "open mouth").
  - **interpretation:** Combines the semantic determinatives 士 (shì, "ritual axe") and 吕(呂) (lǚ, "two blocks") to signal metal objects, with 亼 (jí, "open mouth") as the phonetic indicating the early reading. The graph originally named copper, then generalized to metals and later narrowed to gold, aligning the semantics with modern metal-related senses. An alternative in Shuowen views it as metal in the earth with 亼 as phonetic.
