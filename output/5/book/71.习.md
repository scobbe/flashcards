---
- **traditional:** 習
- **simplified:** 习
- **pronunciation:** xí
- **definition:** to study; to practice
- **contemporary usage:**

  - 习(習)惯(慣) (xíguàn, "habit")
  - 复(複)习(習) (fùxí, "to review")
- **etymology (習):**
  - **type:** ideogrammic compound → simplified character
  - **description:** ideogrammic: 羽 (yǔ, "wings") + 日 (rì, "sun") → ideogrammic: 羽 (yǔ, "wings") + 白 (bái, "white") → simplified as 习(習) (xí, "practice").
  - **interpretation:** Originally combines 羽 (yǔ, "wings") and 日 (rì, "sun") to depict birds repeatedly practicing flight in daylight, hence the sense of practice and learning. In the standard form, 日 was regularized to 白 (bái, "white") without changing the meaning, and PRC simplification collapsed the compound to 习(習) (xí, "practice"). Some sources alternatively analyze the ancient form as phono-semantic with 彗 (huì, "broom") as phonetic and 日 (rì, "sun") as semantic.
  - **component characters:**
    - 羽 (yǔ, "wings")
    - 日 (rì, "sun")
    - 白 (bái, "white")
  - **reference:** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%BF%92
  - **simplification rule (习):** Component elimination and stroke reduction: the compound 習 was simplified by dropping the 白 and 羽 elements and compressing strokes into the single graph 习.
