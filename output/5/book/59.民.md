- **simplified:** 民
- **pronunciation:** mín
- **definition:** people
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 人民 (rénmín, "the people")
  - 公民 (gōngmín, "citizen")
  - 居民 (jūmín, "resident")
  - 农(農)民 (nóngmín, "farmer")
- **etymology (民):**
  - **type:** unknown → phonetic loan
  - **description:** unknown glyph → phonetic loan: 民 (mín, "people").
  - **interpretation:** The original graph is undetermined; later it was borrowed as a phonetic loan to write the word meaning "people," which then became the standard sense. Claims that it depicts an eye pierced by a dagger lack evidence, and proposals linking it to 盲 (máng, "blind") are phonologically implausible.
