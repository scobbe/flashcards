  - **description:** ideogram: 言 (yán, "speech") + 口 (kǒu, "mouth") with 甘 (gān, "sweet") shape indicating the tongue → vertical stroke dropped as in 言 → 甘 stylized as 曰 (yuē, "say").
  - **interpretation:** The graph combines 言 and 口 with a 甘-shaped element representing the tongue to indicate sound coming from the mouth. Later, the tongue’s vertical stroke was dropped as in 言, and 甘 was stylized as 曰, forming the current shape. This directly matches the modern senses related to sound, speech, and pronunciation.
