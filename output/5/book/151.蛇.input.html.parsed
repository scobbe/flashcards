蛇

Character forms: 蛇 U+86C7 , &#34503; CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-86C7 ← 蛆 [U+86C6] CJK Unified Ideographs 蛈 → [U+86C8] Glyph origin: Historical forms of the character 蛇 Warring States Shuowen Jiezi (compiled in Han ) Liushutong (compiled in Ming ) Qin slip script Small seal script Transcribed ancient scripts Characters in the same phonetic series ( 它 ) ( Zhengzhang, 2003 ) Old Chinese 佗 *l̥ʰaːl, *l'aːl 拕 *l̥ʰaːl, *l'aːlʔ 它 *l̥ʰaːl 蛇 *l̥ʰaːl, *ɦljaːl, *lal 袉 *l̥ʰaːlʔ, *l'aːl, *l'aːlʔ 鴕 *l'aːl 駝 *l'aːl 紽 *l'aːl 鮀 *l'aːl 陀 *l'aːl 沱 *l'aːl, *l'aːlʔ 跎 *l'aːl 詑 *l'aːl, *l'aːlʔ, *hlel, *lal, *l̥ʰoːl 酡 *l'aːl 迱 *l'aːl 舵 *l'aːlʔ 柁 *l'aːlʔ 鉈 *ɦljaːl, *hljal Phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *l̥ʰaːl, *ɦljaːl, *lal ): semantic 虫 + phonetic 它 ( OC *l̥ʰaːl ) . 它 was also the original pictographic form of this character. Etymology: Unclear. Various theories have been proposed: Starostin sets up Proto-Sino-Tibetan *lăj ( “ snake ” ) , comparing this with Mizo hlai-ba ( “ a species of snake ” ) and Jingpho palai ( “ a species of iguana ” ) . He also compares it to Proto-Kam-Sui *dzuːi² ( “ snake ” ) . Schuessler (2007) considers these Tibeto-Burman forms to be unrelated. Matisoff (2003) relates it to Proto-Sino-Tibetan *s-b/m-ruːl ( “ snake ” ) , but this comparison is no longer held in STEDT. Sagart (2005) relates it to Proto-Loloish *lay¹/² ( “ python ” ) , which STEDT derives from Proto-Sino-Tibetan *g-lja(ŋ/k) ( “ python ” ) , as well as Proto-Austronesian *bulay ( “ snake ” ) . Comparison with the Austronesian form has been challenged by Orlandi (2018) . Schuessler (2007) notes similarity to Proto-Hlai *ljaːɦ ( “ snake ” ) (from Pre-Hlai *Cilaːɦ ) as well as to Austronesian words, such as Rade ala ( “ snake ” ) , but considers the Kra-Dai forms to be possible borrowings from Chinese. (He does not seem to address the Austronesian forms directly.) In his view, a more likely relationship is with the /-lé/ in Khmer រលេ ( rɔlei , “ sinuously , in a twisting or wiggling manner (as a snake swimming) ” ) . In Old Chinese, this also provides the second syllable in 委蛇 ( OC *qrol lal , “ winding ; compliant ; graceful ”). 蛇 ( “ the winding thing ” ) is then a euphemism for common Sino-Tibetan 虺 ( OC *hŋlulʔ , “snake”) for taboo reasons. Zhengzhang (2011) relates it to Proto-Austronesian *SulaR ( “ snake ” ) . Definitions: ( Cantonese ) sir ( used when addressing policemen or male schoolteachers )
