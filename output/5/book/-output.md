  - **description:** phonetic: 臱 (mián, "sound") → phono-semantic: semantic 辶(辵) (chuò, "walking; movement") + phonetic 臱 (mián, "sound").
  - **interpretation:** Early forms used 臱 (mián, "phonetic") as the sound base; later 辶(辵) (chuò, "walking; movement") was added to form a phono-semantic compound. 辶 conveys movement along paths and peripheries, aligning with modern senses of edges, sides, and borders, while 臱 carries the pronunciation.

  - **interpretation:** 自 acts as the semantic element indicating origin or direction, while 丙 provides the phonetic value yielding an OC reading like *men. The later addition of 方 ties the graph to the notion of side/direction, which aligns with its role as the original form of a border/edge graph; the replacement of 丙 by 穴 is a graphic corruption without semantic impact. Some sources also suggest 自 may have contributed phonetically via association with 鼻 as an alternative view.

  - 学(學)校 (xué xiào, "a school")
  - 学(學)费(費) (xué fèi, "tuition fees")
- **etymology (學):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** phono-semantic: phonetic 爻 (yáo, "crossed lines") + phonetic 六 (liù, "six") → semantic: 子 (zǐ, "child") added → semantic: 冖 (mì, "cover") replaces 六.
  - **interpretation:** Originally the graph used 爻 (yáo, "crossed lines") and 六 (liù, "six") as phonetics, then added 子 (zǐ, "child") as a determinative to mark learning. Later forms regularized the top into 冖 (mì, "cover"), while 子 continued to signal the pedagogical domain, matching the modern senses of study and learning. An alternative analysis treats it as a semantic composition related to teaching under a roof, but early forms lack the child.

  - **interpretation:** Originally a phono-semantic compound with 心 as the semantic determinative (“heart”) and 旡 as the phonetic. A bottom element 夊 was later appended and the top evolved into 爫 under 冖, giving the traditional structure; the simplified form then replaced the lower part with 友 to streamline the graph.

- **etymology (民):**
  - **type:** phonetic loan
  - **description:** unknown original meaning → phonetic loan: 民 (mín, "people").
  - **interpretation:** The original graph is uncertain. It was later borrowed phonetically to write 民 (mín, "people"), so the modern sense derives from the spoken word rather than the form. Alternative ideas such as an eye pierced by a dagger or identification with 盲 (máng, "blind") are considered unsubstantiated or phonologically mismatched.

  - **interpretation:** It depicts strings on a piece of wood, representing a stringed instrument, hence the meaning “music.” The later addition of 白 between the strings may either depict a thumb plucking or serve as a phonetic element; this visual-phonetic enhancement helped solidify the musical sense and later extended to “joy.”

Early texts often used this graph for 祖 (zǔ, "ancestor"); some scholars instead see it as the sacrificial vessel 俎 (zǔ, "sacrificial vessel") or even a phallic symbol.

  - **interpretation:** 夂 (zhǐ, "sole of foot") combines with 口 (kǒu, "mouth/entrance") to depict approaching an opening, hence the sense "to come, to enter". The graph was later applied to write a Sino-Tibetan distributive word derived from 举(舉) (jǔ, "raise") plus a suffix -k, so the modern meaning "each" is historical rather than graphically motivated. Some interpret 口 as an entrance opening to a cave or building.

This explains modern senses like raising something, holding ceremonies, or electing. Some analyses also relate it to 舁 (yú, "to lift") as a k-prefixed variant.

Shuowen alternatively analyzed it as an ideogram of two legs followed by something from behind, yielding the same meaning; it is unrelated to 冬 (dōng, "winter") or 散 (sàn, "scatter"). In later usage the same graph also served as an ancient form of 终(終) (zhōng, "end") and as a variant of 夊 (suī, "slow"), which are distinct from the original pictographic sense.
