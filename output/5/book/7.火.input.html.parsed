火

Character forms: 火 U+706B , &#28779; CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-706B ← 灪 [U+706A] CJK Unified Ideographs 灬 → [U+706C] Glyph origin: Historical forms of the character 火 Shang Western Zhou Spring and Autumn Warring States Shuowen Jiezi (compiled in Han ) Liushutong (compiled in Ming ) Oracle bone script Bronze inscriptions Bronze inscriptions Chu slip and silk script Qin slip script Small seal script Transcribed ancient scripts Characters in the same phonetic series ( 火 ) ( Zhengzhang, 2003 ) Old Chinese 火 *qʰʷaːlʔ 邩 *qʰʷaːlʔ 伙 *qʰʷaːlʔ Pictogram ( 象形 ) – pictographic representation of a fire. Written as 灬 when at the bottom of a character, but still seen in the original form in the character 灸 . See also the top component of 叟 in its original form and the bottom part of 赤 . Etymology: Possibly from Proto-Sino-Tibetan *məj ( Schuessler 2007 ; STEDT). However, see there for phonological problems. Sagart & Baxter (2024) update its Old Chinese pronunciation to 火 ( OC *X.pˤərʔ ) (whence MC xwaX → huǒ ) and propose alternative cognacy to 燹 ( OC *X.pər(ʔ)-s ) (whence MC xwijH ), both being prefixed by unknown element X- which turned the labial plosive *p(ʰ)- into the fricative *xw- ; moreover, both are cognates to 燹 ( OC *sə-pˤər(ʔ)-s ) (whence MC senX → xiǎn ). They also propose that aforesaid Chinese words are cognates to Proto-Tibeto-Burman *par (i.e. STEDT Etymon #2152 *bʷar ~ *pʷar ( “ fire; burn; kindle; roast ” ) , see there for descendants) as well as Proto-Austronesian *dapuʀ ( “ cooking fire, hearth ” ) .
