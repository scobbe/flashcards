### sub-word

---
- **traditional:** 所
- **simplified:** 所
- **pronunciation:** suǒ
- **definition:** that which; place
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 所以 (suǒyǐ, "for that reason")

  - 派出所 (pàichūsuǒ, "police station")
- **etymology (所):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** phono-semantic: phonetic 户(戶) (hù, "door") + semantic 斤 (jīn, "axe").
  - **interpretation:** The character combines 户(戶) (hù, "door") as the phonetic with 斤 (jīn, "axe") as the semantic, glossed in Shuowen as the sound of hewing wood. The semantic 斤 anchors the sense in an action/tool domain, while 户 guides the reading. Over time the graph developed into a noun/nominalizer meaning "that which" and a noun meaning "place", which explains its modern use in institutional and location words.
