  - **interpretation:** Fire refers to the combustion/steam power of early locomotives, and 车(車) denotes a vehicle; together they name a steam-powered train, later generalized to all trains. Some sources note it may have been modelled on 火船 (huǒchuán, "steamship") or shortened from 火烝车(火烝車) (huǒzhēngchē, "steam carriage"), and it is likely not from 火轮车(火輪車) (huǒlúnchē, "paddle-wheel vehicle").
