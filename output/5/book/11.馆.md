  - **description:** phono-semantic: semantic: 饣(飠) (shí, "food") + phonetic: 官 (guān, "official").
  - **interpretation:** The character combines the semantic element 饣 ‘food’ with the phonetic 官, which gives the sound guǎn. The semantic component situates the meaning in food, lodging, and hospitality. This later broadened from inns and eateries to halls and public buildings, yielding modern senses like libraries and museums.
