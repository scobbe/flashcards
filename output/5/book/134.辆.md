  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** phono-semantic: semantic: 车(車) (chē, "vehicle") + phonetic: 两(兩) (liǎng, "two").
  - **interpretation:** It combines 车(車) (chē, "vehicle") as the semantic determinative with 两(兩) (liǎng, "two") as the phonetic; the 'two/pair' sense evokes a set of wheels, aligning with its classifier use for vehicles. Some also view it as the exopassive of 两 ('that which is paired'), and similarities to a Proto-Tibeto-Burman cart term have been noted.
