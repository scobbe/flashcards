- **etymology (多):**
  - **type:** ideogrammic compound
  - **description:** ideogrammic: 肉 (ròu, "meat") + 肉 (ròu, "meat") → written as 夕 (xī, "evening") + 夕 (xī, "evening").
  - **interpretation:** Originally it combined two instances of 肉 (ròu, "meat") to indicate plurality. In bronze inscriptions, 肉 was replaced by visually similar 夕 (xī, "evening"), and the duplicated form was inherited into later scripts. Some explain the sense as many because two meats were notable in scarcity (Chi), while others attribute the meaning to the duplicative structure itself, analogous to 林 from 木 (Chang Ping-chuan).
