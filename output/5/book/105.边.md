---
- **traditional:** 邊
- **simplified:** 边
- **pronunciation:** biān

  - 边(邊)疆 (biān jiāng, "border region")
  - 边(邊)际(際) (biān jì, "limit; bounds")
- **etymology (邊):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** phonetic: 臱 (mián, "sound") → phono-semantic: semantic 辶(辵) (chuò, "walking; movement") + phonetic 臱 (mián, "sound").
  - **interpretation:** Early forms used 臱 (mián, "phonetic") as the sound base; later 辶(辵) (chuò, "walking; movement") was added to form a phono-semantic compound. 辶 conveys movement along paths and peripheries, aligning with modern senses of edges, sides, and borders, while 臱 carries the pronunciation.
  - **component characters:**
    - 臱 (mián, "sound")
    - 辶(辵) (chuò, "walking; movement")
  - **reference:** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%82%8A
  - **simplification rule (边):** In the simplified form 边, the complex phonetic component 臱 was replaced by 力 to reduce strokes while retaining the semantic radical 辶; this replacement was standardized in 1956.
