春

Character forms: 春 U+6625 , &#26149; CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-6625 ← 昤 [U+6624] CJK Unified Ideographs 昦 → [U+6626] Glyph origin: Historical forms of the character 春 Shang Spring and Autumn Warring States Shuowen Jiezi (compiled in Han ) Liushutong (compiled in Ming ) Libian (compiled in Qing ) Oracle bone script Bronze inscriptions Chu slip and silk script Small seal script Transcribed ancient scripts Clerical script Characters in the same phonetic series ( 屯 ) ( Zhengzhang, 2003 ) Old Chinese 躉 *tuːnʔ 窀 *rduːn, *duːn, *tun 沌 *donʔ, *duːn, *duːnʔ 盹 *tuːnʔ, *tjuns 頓 *tuːns 扽 *tuːns 黗 *tʰuːn, *tʰuːnʔ 吨 *tʰuːnʔ 屯 *duːn, *tun 飩 *duːn 豘 *duːn 軘 *duːn 坉 *duːn 邨 *duːn, *stʰuːn 忳 *duːn 芚 *duːn 庉 *duːn, *duːnʔ 囤 *duːnʔ 迍 *tun 杶 *tʰun 瑃 *tʰun 椿 *tʰun 偆 *tʰunʔ, *tʰjunʔ 肫 *tjun 訰 *tjun, *tjuns 純 *tjunʔ, *djun 春 *tʰjun 蠢 *tʰjunʔ 踳 *tʰjunʔ 惷 *tʰjunʔ 蒓 *djun 賰 *hljunʔ 鬊 *hljuns Originally phono-semantic compound ( 形聲 / 形声 , OC *tʰjun ): semantic 艸 ( “ grass ” ) + phonetic 屯 ( OC *duːn, *tun , “ sprout ” ) + semantic 日 ( “ sun ” ) . However, the sprout as a phonetic component can be another reference to plants growing. The sun was added later, thus leading to the intermediate version 萅 . Eventually, 艸 and 屯 merged into 𡗗 . The character 春 itself is probably a variant of 屯 ( OC *duːn, *tun ) as they are equivalent for the meaning “spring” in Old Chinese literature. Unrelated to 泰 . Etymology: simp. and trad. 春 alternative forms 萅 旾 㫩 𣇸 𣈤 Schuessler (2007) relates it to 芚 ( OC *duːn , “(of plants) to begin to grow”); he also compares it Khmer ដុះ ( doh , “ to grow; to germinate; to sprout ” ) , as well as 穿 ( OC *kʰljon, *kʰljons , “to bore through”) ( ibid. ). Sagart (2023b) relates it to a vulgar (i.e. ignoble and popular) word which means "egg", which lacked a character , whose modern reflexes are Meixian Hakka 春 ( cun 1 , “ egg, roe ” ) , Sixian Hakka 春 ( chhûn ) , and Cantonese 春 ( ceon 1 , “ egg, roe; testicle ” ) ( IPA : /t͡ʃʰɵn⁵⁵/ ); and for which he further reconstructs Old Chinese *tʰu[n] ~ * tʰu[r] . He further relates OC *tʰu[n] ~ * tʰu[r] to Bodo (India) dəy , Mizo tui , Proto-Karen *ʔdejᴮ , from tentative Proto-Sino-Tibetan *tʰur , (STEDT, however, reconstructs *d(w)əy ( “ egg, testicle ” ) ) and notes a connection between "eggs" and Chinese new year season, as birds generally nest and lay eggs in the warmer months in the north [1] .
