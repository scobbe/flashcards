- **etymology (熱):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** phonetic: 埶 (yì, "power") + semantic: 灬 (huǒ, "fire").
  - **interpretation:** The character combines the semantic determinative 灬 for fire/heat with the phonetic element 埶, giving a pronunciation close to rè and a meaning centered on heat. Some scholars also relate it to a Proto-Sino-Tibetan root meaning “warm,” but it is generally analyzed as a phono-semantic compound.
  - **component characters:**
    - 埶
    - 灬
  - **reference:** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%86%B1
  - **simplification rule (热):** Simplified from 熱 by replacing the complex phonetic component 埶 with the simpler 执 and retaining the bottom determinative 灬, reducing strokes and regularizing the form.
