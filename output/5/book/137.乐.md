  - **interpretation:** Strings on a piece of wood depict a stringed musical instrument, yielding the sense ‘music’. In later bronze forms a 白 element was added, likely representing the thumb plucking the strings, though some interpret it as a phonetic addition. The concrete instrument imagery naturally extends to modern uses related to music, while association with pleasurable sound explains the ‘joy’ reading that persists today.
