## district; area
### sub-word
#### suburb; outskirts
---
- **traditional:** 區
- **simplified:** 区
- **pronunciation:** qū
- **definition:** district; area
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 区(區)域 (qū yù, "region")
  - 地区(區) (dì qū, "region")
  - 社区(區) (shè qū, "community")
  - 行政区(區) (xíng zhèng qū, "administrative division")
- **etymology (區):**
  - **type:** ideogrammic compound
  - **description:** ideogrammic: 匸 (xì, "enclosure") + 品 (pǐn, "many people") → ideogrammic: 匸 (xì, "enclosure") + 乂 (yì, "to regulate").
  - **interpretation:** Originally, many people (品) enclosed by 匸 suggested a bounded space where people gather, yielding the sense of an area or district. In simplification, 品 was replaced by 乂 while retaining the enclosing 匸, and 乂 evokes regulation and ordering, aligning with the modern sense of an administratively defined district.
  - **component characters:**
    - 匸
    - 品
    - 乂
  - **reference:** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%8D%80
  - **simplification rule (区):** The internal component 品 was replaced by 乂 inside the enclosure, reducing strokes and regularizing the structure in the simplified script.
