  - **description:** ideogrammic: 亲(親) (qīn, "hazelnut tree") + 斤 (jīn, "axe") → phono-semantic: phonetic: 亲(親) (qīn, "hazelnut tree") + semantic: 斤 (jīn, "axe").
  - **interpretation:** It originally combined 亲 as a stylized hazelnut tree or branch and 斤 as an axe to depict cutting wood, an act associated with commencing afresh and thus ‘new’. Later it was reinterpreted as a phono-semantic character with 亲 supplying the sound and 斤 marking the semantic domain of tools/actions, aligning with the modern sense of newness.
