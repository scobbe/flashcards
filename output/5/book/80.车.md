  - **interpretation:** It depicts a carriage viewed from above, with two wheels and a central platform marked by 田. As writing conventions shifted and forms were streamlined, the round elements were reduced to straight strokes, and the simplified 车 was taken from cursive. This pictographic origin aligns with its modern use for vehicles.
