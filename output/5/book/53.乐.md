## music
### sub-word
#### folk music
---
- **traditional:** 樂
- **simplified:** 乐
- **pronunciation:** yuè
- **definition:** music
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 乐(樂)队(隊) (yuèduì, "band")
  - 乐(樂)器 (yuèqì, "musical instrument")
  - 乐(樂)谱(譜) (yuèpǔ, "sheet music")
  - 乐(樂)团(團) (yuètuán, "orchestra")
- **etymology (樂):**
  - **type:** ideogrammic compound
  - **description:** ideogrammic: 糸 (mì, "string") + 木 (mù, "wood") → phonetic: 白 (bái, "white") added between the strings.
  - **interpretation:** It depicts strings on a piece of wood, representing a stringed instrument, hence the meaning “music.” The later addition of 白 between the strings may either depict a thumb plucking or serve as a phonetic element; this visual-phonetic enhancement helped solidify the musical sense and later extended to “joy.”
  - **component characters:**
    - 糸
    - 木
    - 白
  - **reference:** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%A8%82
  - **simplification rule (乐):** The simplified form adopts an earlier cursive vernacular variant that compresses the original multi-part graph, removing internal components for stroke reduction and standardizing the outline.
