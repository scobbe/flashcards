- **etymology (演):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** phono-semantic: semantic: 氵 (shuǐ, "water") + phonetic: 寅 (yín, "third earthly branch") → 演.
  - **interpretation:** 氵 serves as the semantic determinative, pointing to flowing or extension, while 寅 supplies the approximate sound. The original sense was "to flow out; extend," which broadened to "develop, evolve" and then to "perform/put on," as carrying out arranged actions extended metaphorically from the idea of flow and progression.
