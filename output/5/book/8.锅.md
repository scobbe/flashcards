## pot; pan
---
- **traditional:** 鍋
- **simplified:** 锅
- **pronunciation:** guō
- **definition:** pot; pan
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 锅(鍋)里(裡)有汤(湯) (guō lǐ yǒu tāng, "there is soup in the pot")
  - 锅(鍋)盖(蓋) (guōgài, "pot lid")
  - 锅(鍋)铲(鏟) (guōchǎn, "wok spatula")
  - 火锅(鍋) (huǒguō, "hot pot")
- **etymology (鍋):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** phono-semantic: semantic: 钅(釒) (jīn, "metal") + phonetic: 呙(咼) (guō, "phonetic").
  - **interpretation:** The character combines the metal determinative 钅(釒), indicating a metal object, with the phonetic 呙(咼), which cues the reading near guō. This neatly fits its core sense of metal cookware in modern use. The “blame; fault” sense is a later clipping of 黑锅 and does not reflect the original formation.
  - **component characters:**
    - 钅(釒) (jīn, "metal")
    - 呙(咼) (guō, "phonetic")
  - **reference:** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%8D%8B
  - **simplification rule (锅):** Simplified by replacing the left-side component 釒 with the radical form 钅 and substituting the phonetic 咼 with 呙 to reduce strokes and standardize shapes.
