---
- **traditional:** 樂

- **etymology (樂):**
  - **type:** ideogrammic compound
  - **description:** ideogrammic: 纟(糸) (sī, "silk") + 木 (mù, "wood") → semantic: 白 (bái, "thumb").
  - **interpretation:** It depicts strings 纟(糸) on wood 木, representing a stringed musical instrument and thus “music”. In later bronze forms, 白 was added between the strings, possibly showing the thumb plucking (semantic) or serving as a phonetic element; both views are noted in the literature.

    - 白
  - **reference:** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%A8%82
  - **simplification rule (乐):** Adopted a long-attested cursive/vernacular variant that compresses the 糸 + 白 + 糸 + 木 structure into a five-stroke form, reducing strokes and regularizing the graph.
