  - **interpretation:** Depicts a carriage seen from above, with side wheels and a load bed. As writing became vertical, the wheels were rendered as side strokes and the bed marked by 田; cursive writing later yielded the simplified 车 used today. Some scholars discuss the word as a loan from Indo-European or a derivation from 舁, but the character’s pictographic origin explains its vehicle sense.
