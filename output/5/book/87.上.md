  - **description:** ideogram: 一 (yī, "one") + 一 (yī, "one") → differentiation from 二 (èr, "two") by adding a short vertical stroke.
  - **interpretation:** It depicts one line placed above another to indicate the notion of being higher or above. To avoid confusion with 二, a short vertical stroke was added in the later standard form. This visual schema naturally yields the modern meanings of “up,” “above,” and related senses.
