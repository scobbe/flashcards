---
- **traditional:** 相
- **simplified:** 相
- **pronunciation:** xiàng
- **definition:** image; appearance

- **etymology (相):**
  - **type:** ideogrammic compound
  - **description:** ideogrammic: 木 (mù, "tree") + 目 (mù, "eye") → original sense "to observe" → later borrowing for 相 (xiāng, "mutually").
  - **interpretation:** Combining 目 "eye" with 木 "tree" depicts looking at or inspecting something, yielding the early sense "to observe". From observing and judging, the character extended to notions of appearance and features in modern use, while it was later borrowed to also write the unrelated sense "mutually".
