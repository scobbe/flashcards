## to drive; to operate
### sub-word
#### to drive a car
---
- **traditional:** 開
- **simplified:** 开
- **pronunciation:** kāi
- **definition:** to drive; to operate
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 开(開)车(車) (kāichē, "drive a car")

  - 开(開)电(電)脑(腦) (kāi diànnǎo, "turn on the computer")
- **etymology (開):**
  - **type:** ideogrammic compound
  - **description:** ideogrammic: 门(門) (mén, "door") + 一 (yī, "latch") + 廾 (gǒng, "hands") → simplified by removing 门(門).
  - **interpretation:** It combines a door, a latch or wooden bar, and two hands to depict hands opening a latched door, yielding the core sense "open." This sense extends to starting or turning on devices and to operating or driving vehicles; the simplified form omits the outer door radical while retaining the meaningful inner element.

  - **simplification rule (开):** Simplified by removing the door radical 门 from 開, keeping the inner 开 element for stroke reduction and graphic regularization.
