奏

Character forms: 奏 U+594F , &#22863; CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-594F ← 奎 [U+594E] CJK Unified Ideographs 奐 → [U+5950] Glyph origin: Historical forms of the character 奏 Shuowen Jiezi (compiled in Han ) Liushutong (compiled in Ming ) Small seal script Transcribed ancient scripts Characters in the same phonetic series ( 奏 ) ( Zhengzhang, 2003 ) Old Chinese 奏 *ʔsoːs 凑 *sʰoːs 腠 *sʰoːs 輳 *sʰoːs 楱 *sʰoːs, *zoːs 湊 *sʰoːs Ideogrammic compound ( 會意 / 会意 ): two hands ( 廾 ) holding an object, perhaps a musical instrument used during a sacrifical ritual (the lower part of the object originally was similar to 夲 ). Otherwise, the whole character depicts two hands collecting resin ( 桼 ) dripping from a cut tree (drawn like 屮 ). The resin is visible at the bottom of the character. Etymology: Connected to 走 ( OC *ʔsoːʔ, *ʔsoːs , “to run”) by Schuessler (2007) , though the Baxter-Sagart reconstruction of the Old pronunciations makes a connection less likely. Note, however, similarities to Burmese ဆော့ ( hcau. , “ to play, fiddle with ” ) .
