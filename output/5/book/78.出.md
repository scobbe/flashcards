## to go out; to emit
### sub-word
#### taxi
---
- **traditional:** 出
- **simplified:** 出
- **pronunciation:** chū
- **definition:** to go out; to emit
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 出来(來) (chūlái, "come out")
  - 出国(國) (chūguó, "go abroad")
  - 出现(現) (chūxiàn, "to appear")
  - 出发(發) (chūfā, "set out")
- **etymology (出):**
  - **type:** ideogrammic compound
  - **description:** ideogrammic: 止 (zhǐ, "foot") + 凵 (kǎn, "cave") → 出 (chū, "go out").
  - **interpretation:** Combines 止 (zhǐ, "foot") and 凵 (kǎn, "cave") to depict a foot stepping out of a cave, yielding the sense of exiting that underlies modern meanings like going out or emitting. By the Qin, the form became distorted, leading Shuowen to reinterpret it as a pictogram of 屮 (chè, "sprout") growing outward; this is now regarded as mistaken.
