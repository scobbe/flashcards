## pot; pan
### sub-word
#### hotpot
---
- **traditional:** 鍋
- **simplified:** 锅
- **pronunciation:** guō
- **definition:** pot; pan
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 锅(鍋)巴 (guō bā, "scorched rice")
  - 锅(鍋)贴(貼) (guō tiē, "potstickers")
  - 锅(鍋)炉(爐) (guō lú, "boiler")
  - 火锅(鍋) (huǒ guō, "hot pot")
- **etymology (鍋):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** phono-semantic: semantic: 金 (jīn, "metal") + phonetic: 咼 (guō, "crooked") → cooking pot.
  - **interpretation:** The semantic component 金 signals a metal object, fitting a cooking vessel. The phonetic 咼 supplies the approximate sound guō. The extended sense “blame; fault” comes from a later clipping of 黑锅, not from the original formation.
  - **component characters:**
    - 金 (jīn, "metal")
    - 咼 (guō, "crooked")
  - **reference:** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%8D%8B
  - **simplification rule (锅):** Component replacement and stroke reduction: 釒 was simplified to 钅 and 咼 was simplified to 呙 to form the simplified character 锅.
