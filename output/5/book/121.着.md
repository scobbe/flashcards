---

- **etymology (著):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** phono-semantic: semantic 艹(艸) (cǎo, "grass") + phonetic 者 (zhě, "person").
  - **interpretation:** Originally a phono-semantic character with 艹(艸) indicating the semantic domain and 者 supplying the sound. The popular variant 着 developed from 著; meanings extended from the idea of putting or applying something onto a surface to the resultative notion of an action taking effect, yielding modern zháo “to catch; to succeed.”

    - 艹(艸) (cǎo, "grass")
    - 者 (zhě, "person")
  - **reference:** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%91%97
  - **simplification rule (着):** The simplified form standardizes a longstanding popular variant of 著 by replacing the top 艹 with a simplified component and regularizing the lower part, reducing strokes and yielding a more uniform structure.
