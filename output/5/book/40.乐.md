## music
### sub-word
#### concert
---
- **traditional:** 樂
- **simplified:** 乐
- **pronunciation:** yuè
- **definition:** music
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 乐(樂)队(隊) (yuè duì, "band")

  - 乐(樂)团(團) (yuè tuán, "orchestra")
  - 乐(樂)谱(譜) (yuè pǔ, "sheet music")
- **etymology (樂):**
  - **type:** ideogrammic compound
  - **description:** ideogrammic: 纟(糸) (sī, "string") + 木 (mù, "wood") → addition of 白 (bái, "white") between the strings.
  - **interpretation:** It depicts strings stretched on wood, i.e., a stringed instrument, hence the sense “music.” The later addition of 白 is variously taken as a thumb plucking the strings or as a phonetic element, while the association of music with pleasure led to the extended sense “joy.”
  - **component characters:**

    - 木

  - **simplification rule (乐):** Adopted from a long-used cursive and vulgar variant that condensed the original multi-part graph into a five-stroke form, reflecting stroke reduction and component fusion.
