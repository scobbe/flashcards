---
- **traditional:** 愛
- **simplified:** 爱
- **pronunciation:** ài

  - 爱(愛)说(說)话(話) (ài shuō huà, "likes to talk")
- **etymology (愛):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** phono-semantic: 旡 (jì, "not") + 心 (xīn, "heart") → added 夊 (suī, "foot") at bottom → top evolved to 爫 (zhǎo, "claw") under 冖 (mì, "cover") → simplified: lower part replaced with 友 (yǒu, "friend").
  - **interpretation:** Originally a phono-semantic compound with 心 as the semantic determinative (“heart”) and 旡 as the phonetic. A bottom element 夊 was later appended and the top evolved into 爫 under 冖, giving the traditional structure; the simplified form then replaced the lower part with 友 to streamline the graph. The determinative 心 anchors the character in the domain of feelings, matching the modern sense “to love.”

  - **reference:** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%84%9B
  - **simplification rule (爱):** The simplified form replaced the complex lower 心 + 夊 cluster of the traditional graph with 友, reducing strokes and regularizing the structure under 冖.
