### sub-word

---
- **traditional:** 民
- **simplified:** 民
- **pronunciation:** mín
- **definition:** people
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 民众(眾) (mínzhòng, "general public")
  - 公民 (gōngmín, "citizen")
  - 居民 (jūmín, "resident")
  - 民族 (mínzú, "ethnic group")
- **etymology (民):**
  - **type:** phonetic loan
  - **description:** unknown original meaning → phonetic loan: 民 (mín, "people").
  - **interpretation:** The original graph is uncertain. It was later borrowed phonetically to write 民 (mín, "people"), so the modern sense derives from the spoken word rather than the form. Alternative ideas such as an eye pierced by a dagger or identification with 盲 (máng, "blind") are considered unsubstantiated or phonologically mismatched.
