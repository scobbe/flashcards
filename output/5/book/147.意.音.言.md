## speech
### sub-component
#### sound
---
- **traditional:** 言
- **simplified:** 言
- **pronunciation:** yán
- **definition:** speech
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 言语(語) (yányǔ, "speech and words")
  - 言论(論) (yánlùn, "public discourse")
  - 发(發)言 (fāyán, "make a statement")
  - 留言 (liúyán, "leave a message")
- **etymology (言):**
  - **type:** ideogram
  - **description:** ideogram: 舌 (shé, "tongue") with added top stroke indicating movement → 言 (yán, "speech").
  - **interpretation:** It is based on 舌 (shé, "tongue"), with an added top stroke to indicate the tongue’s motion, yielding the sense of speaking and thus "speech". Later stylization simplified the form while keeping the association with vocal expression. Some sources note an alternative analysis in Shuowen as a phono-semantic with 口 (kǒu, "mouth") as semantic and a separate phonetic, but this is considered erroneous.
