- **traditional:** 與
- **simplified:** 与
- **pronunciation:** yǔ
- **definition:** 
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 与(與)其 (yǔqí, "rather than")
  - 与(與)人为(為)善 (yǔ rén wéi shàn, "be kind to others")
  - 与(與)人民为(為)敌(敵) (yǔ rénmín wéi dí, "be hostile to the people")
  - 与(與)国(國) (yǔ guó, "allied country")
- **etymology (與):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** phono-semantic: phonetic: 舁 (yú, "to lift") + phonetic: 牙 (yá, "tooth").
  - **interpretation:** The character combines 舁 and 牙, both serving as phonetic elements pointing to an Old Chinese syllable like *la. The graph was thus chosen for its sound and later came to write the morpheme meaning “to give; with/and,” with the modern senses arising from usage rather than the components themselves.
  - **component characters:**
    - 舁
    - 牙
  - **reference:** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%88%87
  - **simplification rule (与):** Simplified Chinese adopted the ancient abbreviated form 与 in place of the complex 與, reducing strokes through graphic simplification and component replacement.
