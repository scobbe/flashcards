  - **type:** ideogrammic compound
  - **description:** ideogrammic: 辛 (xīn, "chisel") + 日 (rì, "sun") → "to treat jade" → likely original character of 璋 (zhāng, "jade ornament") or 彰 (zhāng, "manifest").
  - **interpretation:** Depicts a chisel 辛 (xīn, "chisel") piercing a central element that was originally a jade piece, later regularized as 日 (rì, "sun"), conveying the act of working or treating jade. This concrete action extended to the idea of making a distinctive, conspicuous mark, giving senses like “manifest” (cf. 彰) and, by further extension, textual divisions and formal markings such as chapters and seals. Some sources compare it with a root meaning “shine/bright,” which aligns with the ‘manifest’ sense.
