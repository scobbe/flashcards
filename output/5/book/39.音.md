  - **description:** ideogram: 言 (yán, "speech") + 口 (kǒu, "mouth") written like 甘 (gān, "sweet") to depict the tongue inside the mouth → 甘 stylized as 曰 (yuē, "say") → 音 meaning “sound”.
  - **interpretation:** It depicts speech and the mouth, with an element shaped like 甘 indicating the tongue, to represent sound emerging from the mouth. Later, the vertical stroke for the tongue was dropped as in 言, and 甘 was regularized to 曰, yielding the modern graph for the meaning ‘sound’.
