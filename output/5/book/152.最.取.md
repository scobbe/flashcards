- **traditional:** 取
- **simplified:** 取
- **pronunciation:** qǔ
- **definition:** to gather
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 取钱(錢) (qǔqián, "withdraw money")
  - 取得 (qǔdé, "to obtain")
  - 取消 (qǔxiāo, "to cancel")
  - 取笑 (qǔxiào, "make fun of")
- **etymology (取):**
  - **type:** ideogrammic compound
  - **description:** ideogrammic: 耳 (ěr, "ear") + 又 (yòu, "hand") → taking the ear of prey.
  - **interpretation:** It combines 耳 (ear) and 又 (hand), originally depicting a hand taking the ear of fallen prey as a hunter’s trophy, hence the sense ‘to take’. Shuowen instead glossed it as taking an enemy’s ear, but later scholarship notes a lack of evidence for wartime practice. The concrete act generalized to the modern meanings of taking, obtaining, or choosing.
