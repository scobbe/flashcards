## music
### sub-word
#### musical instrument
---
- **traditional:** 樂
- **simplified:** 乐
- **pronunciation:** yuè
- **definition:** music
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 音乐(樂) (yīnyuè, "music")
  - 乐(樂)队(隊) (yuèduì, "band")

  - 乐(樂)谱(譜) (yuèpǔ, "music score")
- **etymology (樂):**
  - **type:** ideogrammic compound
  - **description:** ideogrammic: 糸 (mì, "string") + 木 (mù, "wood") → bronze added 白 (bái, "thumb") as possible phonetic.
  - **interpretation:** It depicts strings attached to a piece of wood, i.e., a stringed instrument, which naturally yields the sense of music. In later bronze forms a central 白 was added, interpreted either as a thumb plucking the strings or as a phonetic aid; the core idea remains a musical instrument, underpinning the modern meaning "music".
  - **component characters:**
    - 糸
    - 木
    - 白
  - **reference:** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%A8%82
  - **simplification rule (乐):** Simplified 乐 was adopted from a long-used cursive/variant form of 樂, reducing strokes by collapsing the multi-part 糸+白+木 structure into a streamlined single graph.
