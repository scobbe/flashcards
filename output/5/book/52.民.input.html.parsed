民

Character forms: 民 U+6C11 , &#27665; CJK UNIFIED IDEOGRAPH-6C11 ← 氐 [U+6C10] CJK Unified Ideographs 氒 → [U+6C12] Glyph origin: Historical forms of the character 民 Western Zhou Shuowen Jiezi (compiled in Han ) Liushutong (compiled in Ming ) Bronze inscriptions Small seal script Transcribed ancient scripts Characters in the same phonetic series ( 民 ) ( Zhengzhang, 2003 ) Old Chinese 眠 *miːn 民 *min 泯 *min, *minʔ 怋 *min, *mɯːn 岷 *mrin 珉 *mrin 罠 *mrin 笢 *mrin, *minʔ 鈱 *mrin 抿 *mrɯn, *mrɯn, *mrɯnʔ 刡 *minʔ 敃 *mrinʔ 愍 *mrinʔ 暋 *mrinʔ 蟁 *mɯn Unknown. Later jiajie ( 假借 ) for 民 ( OC *min , “the people”). Shuowen does not have a glyph origin for this character. Some, including Shirakawa, have claimed that it represents an eye pierced by a dagger, but there is no evidence of such a ritual or punishment having ever taken place. Sometimes explained as the original form of 盲 ( OC *mraːŋ , “blind”), but the phonetics differ too much for this to be believable. Etymology: From Proto-Sino-Tibetan *r-mi(j)-n ( “ people, man, human being ” ) . Cognate with Tibetan མི ( mi ) and Dzongkha མི ( mi ) .
