### sub-word

---
- **traditional:** 發
- **simplified:** 发
- **pronunciation:** fā
- **definition:** to send; to emit
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 发(發)射 (fā shè, "to launch")
  - 发(發)光 (fā guāng, "emit light")
  - 发(發)电(電)子邮(郵)件 (fā diàn zǐ yóu jiàn, "send an email")
  - 发(發)货(貨) (fā huò, "ship goods")
- **etymology (發):**
  - **type:** pictogram → phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** pictogram of 弓 (gōng, "bow") firing an arrow → semantic: 攴 (pū, "hand") added to show action → phono-semantic: semantic 弓 (gōng, "bow"); phonetic 癹 (bá, "steps").
  - **interpretation:** It originally depicts a bow releasing an arrow. The added hand emphasized an act of sending forth, and in the current form the bow serves as the semantic indicator while 癹 supplies the sound, matching modern senses like launching, emitting, and sending.

    - 弓

  - **simplification rule (发):** Stroke reduction and component replacement: the complex traditional graphs 發 and 髮 were collapsed into the single simplified form 发 by simplifying the 發 structure and omitting the hair component in 髮.
