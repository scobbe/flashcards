- **pronunciation:** chū

- **etymology (出):**
  - **type:** ideogrammic compound
  - **description:** ideogrammic: 止 (zhǐ, "foot") + 凵 (kǎn, "cave").
  - **interpretation:** Combining 止 (zhǐ, "foot") with 凵 (kǎn, "cave") depicts stepping out of an opening, hence the sense of exiting or emerging. This visual composition naturally extends to modern meanings like going out, appearing, or emitting. Some later sources misread the distorted form as a plant 屮 growing outward, but this is considered a mistaken interpretation.
