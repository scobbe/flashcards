## to drive; to operate
---
- **traditional:** 開
- **simplified:** 开
- **pronunciation:** kāi
- **definition:** to drive; to operate

- **etymology (開):**
  - **type:** ideogrammic compound
  - **description:** ideogrammic: 门(門) (mén, "door") + 一 (yī, "latch") + 廾 (gǒng, "two hands").
  - **interpretation:** It depicts a pair of hands unlatching a door: 门(門) (mén, "door") with 一 (yī, "latch") acted on by 廾 (gǒng, "two hands"), hence "to open a door". This concrete action extended to general senses like opening, starting, switching on, and operating or driving in modern use. As a simplified form, 开 drops the 门 enclosure but preserves the inner hands-and-latch idea, so the meaning stays the same.
  - **component characters:**

  - **reference:** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%96%8B
  - **simplification rule (开):** Eliminated the 门 enclosure from 開, leaving the inner hands-and-latch element as the independent simplified form 开 to reduce strokes.
