  - **description:**: phono-semantic: semantic: 纟(糹) (sī, "silk") + phonetic: 召 (zhào, "summon").
  - **interpretation:**: 纟(糹) signals the semantic field of threads and continuity, matching senses like continuing or linking introductions. 召 supplies the sound shào and also evokes summoning/calling, compatible with introducing someone. Together they convey connection/continuation via the silk radical’s “thread” metaphor.

  - **simplification rule (绍):**: The left silk component was simplified from 糹 to 纟, a standard radical simplification reducing strokes while retaining the phonetic 召.
