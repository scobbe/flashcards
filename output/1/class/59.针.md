- **simplified:**: 针
- **pronunciation:**: zhēn

- **etymology (針):**
  - **type:**: phono-semantic compound
  - **description:**: semantic: 钅(釒) (jīn, "metal") + phonetic: 十 (shí, "ten").
  - **interpretation:**: This character is a phono-semantic compound: 钅(釒) (jīn, "metal") serves as the semantic determinative and 十 (shí, "ten") provides the phonetic cue. The metal determinative aligns with the modern meaning of a slender metal needle, while the phonetic element approximated the historical pronunciation leading to zhēn.
  - **component characters:**
    - 金
    - 釒
    - 十
  - **reference:**: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%87%9D
  - **simplification rule (针):**: The traditional metal component 釒 was simplified to the abbreviated radical form 钅 on the left side, reducing strokes while keeping the phonetic 十 unchanged.
