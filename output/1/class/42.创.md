- **etymology (創):**
  - **type:**: phono-semantic compound
  - **description:**: phonetic: 仓(倉) (cāng, "granary") + semantic: 刀 (dāo, "knife") → 创(創) (chuàng/chuāng, "create; wound").
  - **interpretation:**: The character combines 仓(倉) (cāng, "granary") as the phonetic with 刀 (dāo, "knife") as the semantic indicator of cutting, yielding the sense of a knife wound. The original meaning was "wound; cut," and it later extended to chuàng "to initiate/create," metaphorically from cutting or opening a new undertaking.

  - **reference:**: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%89%B5
  - **simplification rule (创):**: The traditional phonetic 倉 was replaced by its simplified form 仓 while retaining the knife side 刂, reducing stroke count to form 创.
