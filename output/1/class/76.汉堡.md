- **etymology (漢堡):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic matching
  - **description:** loanword: Hamburg → phono-semantic matching: phonetic: 汉(漢) (hàn, "Han Chinese") + semantic: 堡 (bǎo, "fortress").
  - **interpretation:** 堡 (bǎo, "fortress") supplies the meaning, matching the -burg element in German place names, while 汉(漢) (hàn, "Han Chinese") contributes the syllable han to approximate “Ham-”. Thus 汉堡 was coined to render Hamburg; the food sense developed as a short form of 汉(漢)堡包 (hànbǎobāo, "Hamburg bun"). Sources differ on whether English or German served as the immediate donor language, but the mapping is the same.
