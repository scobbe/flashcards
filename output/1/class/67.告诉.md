  - **interpretation:** Combining 告 "inform" with 诉 "complain/plead" yields the sense of conveying something to someone, hence "to tell/inform" in everyday use. In legal contexts, the 诉 component motivates the formal sense "to file a complaint" that persists in modern usage.

  - **simplification rule (告诉):** The compound was simplified by replacing 訴 with 诉 via reducing the speech radical 言 to 讠 and streamlining strokes; 告 remained unchanged, regularizing variant forms.
