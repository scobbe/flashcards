### sub-word
#### traditional Chinese medicine; TCM doctor
---
- **traditional:**: 醫
- **simplified:**: 医
- **pronunciation:**: yī
- **definition:**: medical
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 医(醫)疗(療) (yīliáo, "medical treatment")
  - 医(醫)学(學) (yīxué, "medicine")
  - 医(醫)院 (yīyuàn, "hospital")
  - 医(醫)生 (yīshēng, "doctor")
- **etymology (醫):**
  - **type:**: ideogrammic compound → phono-semantic compound
  - **description:**: ideogrammic: 匸 (xì, "storage") + 矢 (shǐ, "arrow") → phono-semantic: phonetic: 殹 (yì, "interjection") + semantic: 酉 (yǒu, "liquor").
  - **interpretation:**: Originally, 医 depicts an enclosure with an arrow, referring to a container for storing bows/arrows. The medical sense developed in 醫, where 酉 serves as the semantic determinative for medicinal liquids and 殹 provides the sound. In modern Simplified Chinese, 醫 was simplified back to 医 while retaining the medical meanings.
  - **component characters:**
    - 匸
    - 矢
    - 殹
    - 酉
  - **reference:**: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%86%AB
  - **simplification rule (医):**: Simplified by eliminating the 酉 and 殳 components of 醫, reverting to the earlier graph 医 for stroke reduction and graphic economy.
