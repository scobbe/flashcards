  - **description:** phonetic: 矛 (máo, "spear") + semantic: 攵 (pū, "action").
  - **interpretation:** The character combines the semantic determinative 攵 (pū, "action") with the phonetic 矛 (máo), whose Old Chinese value (*mu) aligns with the OC reconstructions for 敄 (*moʔ, *mos). This structure points to meanings involving actions or pursuits, which later appear in the variant 務 as the sense "to engage in; to pursue."
