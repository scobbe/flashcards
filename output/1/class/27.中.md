  - **description:**: pictogram: flagpole with 鼓 (gǔ, "drum") at its center indicating the middle of a field.
  - **interpretation:**: Originally depicts a flagpole with a drum set at the center of a field, marking the middle. This accounts for the core sense “middle/center,” and later the sense “to hit the center; to attain” arose by association with striking the middle. Alternative analyses (Shuowen: 丨 (gǔn, "vertical stroke") through 口 (kǒu, "mouth"); another view: an arrow in a target’s center) also interpret it as indicating the center.
