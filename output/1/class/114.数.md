## number; count
---
- **traditional:** 數
- **simplified:** 数
- **pronunciation:** shù; shǔ
- **definition:** number; count
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 数(數)一下 (shǔ yī xià, "count briefly")
  - 数(數)一数(數)二 (shǔ yī shǔ èr, "one of the best")
  - 数(數)落 (shǔ luò, "criticize")
  - 数(數)不胜(勝)数(數) (shǔ bù shèng shǔ, "too many to count")
- **etymology (數):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** phono-semantic: phonetic 娄(婁) (lóu, "surname Lou") + semantic 攴 (pū, "tap").
  - **interpretation:** The character combines 娄(婁) as a phonetic element with 攴 as a semantic determinative indicating an action, yielding the verb sense "to count." The noun sense "number" developed via an exopassive derivation with an Old Chinese -s suffix, meaning "what is counted." The semantic component fits modern uses involving counting and numbers.
  - **component characters:**
    - 娄(婁) (lóu, "surname Lou")
    - 攴 (pū, "tap")
  - **reference:** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%95%B8
  - **simplification rule (数):** Simplified by replacing the phonetic 婁 with its simplified form 娄 and by using the short right-hand component 攵 for 攴, reducing strokes while preserving the original phono-semantic structure.
