- **traditional:**: 親
- **simplified:**: 亲
- **pronunciation:**: qīn / qìng
- **definition:**: 
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 亲(親)戚 (qīn qī, "relatives")
  - 亲(親)自 (qīn zì, "in person")
  - 亲(親)吻 (qīn wěn, "to kiss")
  - 亲(親)属(屬) (qīn shǔ, "family members")
- **etymology (親):**
  - **type:**: phono-semantic compound
  - **description:**: phonetic: 辛 (xīn, "spicy") + semantic: 见(見) (jiàn, "see") → 亲(親) (qīn, "kin").
  - **interpretation:**: Formed with 见(見) (jiàn, "see") as the semantic indicator of personal contact and 辛 (xīn, "spicy") as the phonetic. The left element was later regularized as 亲(親) (qīn, "kin"), and the sense extended from doing or seeing something in person to ‘close/intimate’ and ‘relatives’.
  - **component characters:**
    - 辛 (xīn, "spicy")
    - 见(見) (jiàn, "see")
    - 親 (qīn, "kin")
  - **reference:**: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%A6%AA
  - **simplification rule (亲):**: The traditional form 親 was simplified by dropping the right-side semantic 见(見) and adopting the left phonetic element 亲 as the whole character, reducing strokes and regularizing the structure.
