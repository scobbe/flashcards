- **pronunciation:**: gāng gāng

  - **description:**: semantic: 刚(剛) (gāng, "just") + 刚(剛) (gāng, "just").
  - **interpretation:**: Formed by reduplicating 刚 to emphasize immediacy. The base 刚 means “just; barely”, and repetition reinforces recency or minimal degree, yielding the modern senses “just now” and “barely”.
