  - **type:**: phono-semantic compound
  - **description:**: phonetic: 冄 (rǎn, "phonetic") + semantic: 邑 (yì, "city").
  - **interpretation:**: Built as a phono-semantic character with 邑 as the semantic determinative indicating a place and 冄 as the phonetic giving the sound. It originally named a state and was later borrowed to write the distal demonstrative “that,” so the place semantics are no longer active in modern use.
