- **simplified:**: 务
- **pronunciation:**: wù
- **definition:**: affairs or duties; to engage in
- **contemporary usage:**

- **etymology (務):**
  - **type:**: phono-semantic compound
  - **description:**: phonetic: 敄 (mò, "phonetic element") + semantic: 力 (lì, "strength").
  - **interpretation:**: The traditional form 务(務) (wù, "affairs") is a phono-semantic compound with 敄 (mò) as the phonetic indicating the wù reading, while 力 (lì, "strength") supplies the semantic field of exertion and work. The simplified form 务 retains this semantic cue, which aligns with modern senses such as duties and engaging in tasks.

    - 敄 (mò, "phonetic element")
    - 力 (lì, "strength")
  - **reference:**: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%8B%99
  - **simplification rule (务):**: Eliminated the 矛 component from 務, reducing strokes and regularizing the top to 夂 over 力.
