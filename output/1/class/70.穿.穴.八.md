  - **description:**: pictogram: depiction of two bent lines dividing → semantic: borrowed to the numeral "eight" due to homophony.
  - **interpretation:**: It depicts two bent lines indicating a split, originally meaning "to divide". Because this was homophonous with the spoken word for the numeral, the graph was borrowed to write "eight" and that sense became dominant; the original sense is now expressed with 分 (fēn, "divide") and 别(別) (bié, "separate").
