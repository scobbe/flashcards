- **etymology (其):**
  - **type:** pictogram → ideogrammic compound
  - **description:** pictogram of 箕 (jī, "winnowing basket") → ideogrammic: 箕 (jī, "winnowing basket") + 丌 (jī, "stand").
  - **interpretation:** It depicts a winnowing basket; later a stand was added, forming a composite that visually suggests a basket on a stand. The graph was subsequently borrowed to write a third-person pronoun, a usage that survived in literary Chinese; some sources note the lower 丌 may also have had a phonetic role.
