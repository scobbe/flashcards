## piece or chunk; yuan (RMB)
---
- **traditional:**: 塊
- **simplified:**: 块
- **pronunciation:**: kuài
- **definition:**: piece or chunk; yuan (RMB)

  - 一块(塊)蛋糕 (yī kuài dàngāo, "a slice of cake")
  - 一块(塊)木头(頭) (yī kuài mùtóu, "a piece of wood")
- **etymology (塊):**
  - **type:**: phono-semantic compound
  - **description:**: phono-semantic: semantic: 土 (tǔ, "earth") + phonetic: 鬼 (guǐ, "ghost") → phonetic: 夬 (guài, "decide").
  - **interpretation:**: The character was formed with 土 as the semantic determinative indicating earth or clods, and a phonetic element providing the sound. In the simplified form, the original phonetic 鬼 was replaced by 夬 to reduce strokes while keeping a similar pronunciation. The earth/clod semantic base explains senses like "lump/piece," later extended to classifier uses such as money in modern speech.
  - **component characters:**
    - 土
    - 鬼
    - 夬
  - **reference:**: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%A1%8A
  - **simplification rule (块):**: Component replacement reduced strokes by substituting the phonetic 鬼 with the simpler 夬 while retaining the semantic 土 and approximate pronunciation.
