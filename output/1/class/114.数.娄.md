- **traditional:** 婁
- **simplified:** 娄
- **pronunciation:** lóu / lǘ / lǚ
- **definition:** 
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 捅娄(婁)子 (tǒng lóu zi, "stir up trouble")
  - 娄(婁)子 (lóu zi, "a mess")
  - 娄(婁)罗(羅) (lóu luó, "gang henchman")
  - 娄(婁)江 (lóu jiāng, "Lou River")
- **etymology (婁):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound → ideogrammic compound
  - **description:** phono-semantic: 爪 (zhǎo, "hands") + 角 (jiǎo, "horn") + 女 (nǚ, "woman") → ideogrammic: 母 (mǔ, "mother") + 中 (zhōng, "middle") + 女 (nǚ, "woman").
  - **interpretation:** Originally, semantic 爪 and 女 marked the human/hand domain while 角 served as the phonetic, yielding a reading similar to modern lóu; the exact original meaning is noted as uncertain in the source. It was later reinterpreted ideogrammically as 母 over 中 and 女, a folk-analytic layout that does not directly motivate the modern proper-noun and surname uses but reflects a later semantic reading.
  - **component characters:**
    - 爪 (zhǎo, "hands")
    - 角 (jiǎo, "horn")
    - 女 (nǚ, "woman")
    - 母 (mǔ, "mother")
    - 中 (zhōng, "middle")
  - **reference:** https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%A9%81
  - **simplification rule (娄):** The traditional form 婁 was simplified by replacing its complex upper structure with 米 and retaining 女 below, regularizing the graph to ⿱米女 for stroke reduction and component standardization.
