## medical
### sub-word
#### hospital
---
- **traditional:**: 醫
- **simplified:**: 医
- **pronunciation:**: yī
- **definition:**: medical
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 医(醫)生 (yī shēng, "doctor")
  - 医(醫)院 (yī yuàn, "hospital")
  - 医(醫)学(學) (yī xué, "medical science")
  - 医(醫)疗(療) (yī liáo, "medical treatment")
- **etymology (醫):**
  - **type:**: ideogrammic compound
  - **description:**: ideogrammic: 匸 (xì, "that which hides; that which stores") + 矢 (shǐ, "arrow").
  - **interpretation:**: The graph combines 匸 (xì, "store") and 矢 (shǐ, "arrow") to indicate a container for arrows, i.e., a quiver—its original sense. In modern use, 医 is the simplified form of 醫 (yī, "medical"), whose semantic determinative 酉 (yǒu, "liquor") ties to medicines and decoctions; simplification removed that component, leaving 医 to carry the medical sense.
  - **component characters:**
    - 匸
    - 矢
  - **reference:**: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%86%AB
  - **simplification rule (医):**: Adopted as the simplified form of 醫 by eliminating the 酉 and 殳 components, reducing strokes and regularizing the shape to 医.
