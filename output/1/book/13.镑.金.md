- **traditional:** 金
- **simplified:** 金
- **pronunciation:** jīn
- **definition:** 
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 合金 (hé jīn, "metal alloy")
  - 金发(髮) (jīn fà, "blond hair")
  - 金钱(錢) (jīn qián, "money and currency")
- **etymology (金):**
  - **type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **description:** phono-semantic compound: semantic: 士 (shì, "ritual axe") + semantic: 丷 (bā, "two metals") + phonetic: 亼 (jí, "now").
  - **interpretation:** The graph combines 士 as a stylized ritual axe and 丷 as two metal nuggets to signal the semantic field of metals, while 亼 (the ancient form of 今) provides the pronunciation. The word originally meant copper, then broadened to metals and later narrowed to gold as a key sense today. Shuowen alternatively explains it as “metal in earth” with 亼 as phonetic, but early forms lack the earth element.
