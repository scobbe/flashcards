## to participate
### sub-word
#### visit 'or' tour
---
- **traditional:**: 參
- **simplified:**: 参
- **pronunciation:**: cān
- **definition:**: to participate
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 参(參)加 (cānjiā, "take part")
  - 参(參)与(與) (cānyù, "participate")
  - 参(參)赛(賽) (cānsài, "enter a competition")
- **etymology (參):**
  - **type:**: ideogrammic compound
  - **description:**: ideogrammic: 晶 (jīng, "stars") + 光 (guāng, "light") + 彡 (shān, "light rays").
  - **interpretation:**: The graph combines 晶 "stars", 光 "light", and 彡 "light rays" to depict the Three Stars asterism and its radiance. The same character was later extended and borrowed to write other morphemes, including cān "to join/participate" and shēn "ginseng", yielding the modern 'participate' sense in compounds. Some sources alternatively analyze the seal-script form as phono-semantic with semantic 晶 and phonetic 㐱, but the bronze forms favor an ideogrammic origin.
  - **component characters:**
    - None, character is in atomic form
  - **reference:**: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%8F%83
  - **simplification rule (参):**: Simplified by reducing the strokes of 參, compressing the multi-part 晶+光+彡 structure into a compact, regularized form while retaining 彡.
