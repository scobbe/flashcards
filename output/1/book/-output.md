- **etymology (次):**
  - **type:**: pictogram
  - **description:**: pictogram: depiction of 欠 (qiàn, "yawn") exhaling, with breath marks written as 二 (èr, "two") or 冫 (bīng, "ice").
  - **interpretation:**: It depicts a person exhaling; the short strokes (later shaped like 二 or 冫) indicate the expelled breath. The graph was later borrowed and generalized to mean ordering and succession (“next”) and as a classifier for occurrences. An alternative Shuowen analysis treats it as 二 + 欠 phono-semantic, but ancient forms do not support this.

- **etymology (二):**
  - **type:**: ideogram
  - **description:**: ideogram: 一 (yī, "one") → 二 (èr, "two").
  - **interpretation:**: The character doubles the single stroke of 一 “one” to form two parallel strokes, directly representing the quantity two. Early numerals were formed additively by tally-like marks, so the shape transparently matches the meaning, which persists unchanged today.

  - **interpretation:**: It depicts a kneeling person with an open mouth, i.e., 人 (rén, "person") and 口 (kǒu, "mouth") suggesting exhalation or vocalizing. This concrete image led to the Mandarin sense 'yawn' and extended to 'lack' or 'owe' via the idea of begging/asking and insufficiency.

  - **interpretation:**: It combines 参(參) (cān, "participate") and 观(觀) (guān, "observe") to mean going to a place in order to observe. This underlies the modern sense of visiting or touring sites for viewing, learning, or inspection.

  - **type:**: ideogrammic compound
  - **description:**: ideogrammic: 晶 (jīng, "stars") + 光 (guāng, "light") + 彡 (shān, "light rays").
  - **interpretation:**: The graph combines 晶 "stars", 光 "light", and 彡 "light rays" to depict the Three Stars asterism and its radiance. The same character was later extended and borrowed to write other morphemes, including cān "to join/participate" and shēn "ginseng", yielding the modern 'participate' sense in compounds. Some sources alternatively analyze the seal-script form as phono-semantic with semantic 晶 and phonetic 㐱, but the bronze forms favor an ideogrammic origin.

  - **description:**: phonetic: 雚 (guàn, "reeds") + semantic: 见 (jiàn, "see") → simplified: 又 (yòu, "again") + 见 (jiàn, "see").
  - **interpretation:**: The traditional form is a phono-semantic compound with 見 as the semantic determinative "to see" and 雚 as the phonetic indicating the sound guān. In simplification, the complex 雚 was replaced by 又 and 見 by 见 to reduce strokes while preserving the "seeing" determinative. This fits the modern senses related to looking, viewing, and observing.

  - **interpretation:**: The character combines 讠(言) as the semantic determinative to indicate meanings related to speech or statements, with 亥 as the phonetic element approximating the sound gāi. The semantic side suits its modern uses in discourse, such as marking what is said (the aforementioned) and expressing deontic modality (should/ought) in statements.

By semantic extension it came to denote the twelfth Earthly Branch, plausibly via a sense of a 'sprouting stage' noted in the entry. An alternative view sees it as an animal like 豕 (shǐ, "pig"), and later graphic convergence strengthened its pig association.

- **traditional:**: 千
- **simplified:**: 千
- **pronunciation:**: qiān
- **definition:**: a thousand
- **contemporary usage:**

  - 千千万(萬)万(萬) (qiān qiān wàn wàn, "countless multitudes")
- **etymology (千):**
  - **type:**: phono-semantic compound
  - **description:**: semantic: 一 (yī, "one") + phonetic: 人 (rén, "person") → phono-semantic compound meaning "thousand".
  - **interpretation:**: 一 (yī, "one") signals that the character belongs to the numeric domain. 人 (rén, "person") provides the sound, whose Old Chinese reading was similar to that of 千 (qiān, "thousand"). A traditional explanation also takes the extra stroke as indicating an extension in counting.

- **etymology (數):**
  - **type:**: phono-semantic compound
  - **description:**: phono-semantic: phonetic: 娄(婁) (lóu, "bundle") + semantic: 攵 (pū, "tap").
  - **interpretation:**: The character combines phonetic 娄(婁) with semantic 攵 indicating an action like tapping/doing, matching the verb sense of counting and, by extension, numerical concepts. 娄(婁) supplies the approximate sound (as reflected in historical reconstructions), while 攵 marks it as an action-related graph.
  - **component characters:**
    - 娄(婁) (lóu, "bundle")

  - **interpretation:**: Originally it combined 爪 (zhǎo, "hands") and 女 (nǚ, "woman") around the phonetic 角 (jiǎo, "horn") to write a word pronounced like lóu; the exact original meaning is uncertain. It was later reinterpreted as an ideogrammic 母 (mǔ, "mother") + 中 (zhōng, "middle") + 女 (nǚ, "daughter"), a folk analysis that did not change the reading. The modern proper-name sense for the lunar mansion and colloquial derivatives persist by convention rather than transparent composition.

  - **interpretation:**: It depicts a flagpole with a drum set at the central point of a field to gather people and gauge wind. Because the object marked the center, the graph came to mean "middle" and later extended to senses like "hit the center" or "attain". Alternatively, Shuowen analyzes it as 丨 (gǔn, "line") passing through 口 (kǒu, "mouth") to indicate the center.

  - **interpretation:**: Originally a phono-semantic graph with 女 and 爪 providing general human/female semantics and 角 giving the sound, while the precise original meaning is noted as uncertain. It was later reinterpreted ideogrammically as 母 + 中 + 女, a folk analysis emphasizing kinship imagery.

Later scholars also analyze it as phono-semantic, with 又 (yòu, "hand") as the semantic indicator and 卜 (bǔ, "divine") as the phonetic. Some sources classify the earliest form as ideogrammic; the modern meaning ‘tap’ reflects a lighter kind of striking.

As noted in the entry, the name was adopted in 1369 under the Ming after the city was taken from the Yuan and fortified, and it persisted as the toponym. The original pacification sense remains only as historical nuance while the term functions as the city's proper name today.

## west
### sub-word
#### Xi'an City
---
- **traditional:**: 西
- **simplified:**: 西
- **pronunciation:**: xī
- **definition:**: west
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 西北风(風) (xī běi fēng, "northwest wind")
  - 西南 (xī nán, "southwest region")
  - 西瓜 (xī guā, "watermelon fruit")
- **etymology (西):**
  - **type:**: pictogram
  - **description:**: pictogram: depiction of a bag or basket → phonetic loan: 西 (xī, "west").
  - **interpretation:**: It depicts a bag or basket. The graph was later borrowed for its sound to write xī “west”, so the modern meaning is a phonetic loan rather than the original picture. An alternative view sees a bird settling into a nest to evoke the setting sun in the west; this is disputed, though Sagart (2004) supports it.

## peace; safe

  - **interpretation:**: Depicts a woman under a roof, suggesting someone settled at home. 宀 (mián, "house") gives the semantic domain, and 女 (nǚ, "woman") supplies the figure; together they express being at ease, hence 'peaceful' and 'safe'. This motivates modern uses for calmness, safety, and settling.

- **etymology (少):**
  - **type:**: pictogram
  - **description:**: pictogram: depiction of four dots indicating few and little → phonetic: 小 (xiǎo, "small").
  - **interpretation:**: It depicts four dots, understood as grains of sand, to convey a small quantity, hence the core sense ‘few/little’. It was later associated phonetically with 小 (xiǎo, "small"), reinforcing the semantics of smallness and supporting the modern readings and extensions such as ‘young’ in compounds.

  - **interpretation:**: It depicts three granules of sand, and by extension came to mean "small" in general because grains are tiny.

- **etymology (排):**
  - **type:**: phono-semantic compound
  - **description:**: semantic: 扌 (shǒu, "hand") + phonetic: 非 (fēi, "not") → 排.
  - **interpretation:**: 扌 serves as the semantic determinative, indicating a hand-related action of arranging or lining up, while 非 provides the phonetic cue for the reading pái. The hand semantic matches modern senses like ordering and lining up, yielding the idea of placing things in line. A comparative note in the entry links the verb to a Proto‑Tibeto‑Burman root meaning ‘to throw’, but this concerns lexical history rather than graphic formation.

  - **interpretation:**: Traditional 隊 was formed with 阜 as the semantic determinative and 㒸 as the phonetic, yielding the reading duì for a troop or team. In simplification, the complex phonetic 㒸 was replaced by 人, making an ideogrammic form 阝 + 人 that visually conveys “many people,” aligning with the modern senses ‘team’ and ‘line’.
