  - **type:** pictogram → phono-semantic compound → ideogrammic compound
  - **description:** pictogram: depiction of acorn → phono-semantic: semantic 日 (rì, "sun") + phonetic 枣(棗) (zǎo, "jujube") → ideogrammic: 日 (rì, "sun") + 甲 (jiǎ, "first").
  - **interpretation:** Early forms depict an acorn and the graph was later borrowed for the ‘morning/early’ reading. In late bronze inscriptions it was reformed as a phono-semantic character with 日 as the semantic determinative for daybreak and 枣 as the phonetic giving the zǎo sound. Xu Shen later reinterpreted it as an ideogram 日 + 甲 ‘first’, referring to when the sun first rises.
