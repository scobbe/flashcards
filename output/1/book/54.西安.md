  - **interpretation:**: Combines 西 (xī, "west") and 安 (ān, "peace; pacify") to denote a pacified or peaceful west. As noted in the entry, the name was adopted in 1369 under the Ming after the city was taken from the Yuan and fortified, and it persisted as the toponym. The original pacification sense remains only as historical nuance while the term functions as the city's proper name today.
