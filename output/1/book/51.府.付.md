  - **description:**: ideogrammic: 亻 (rén, "person") + 寸 (cùn, "hand").
  - **interpretation:**: Combining 亻 (rén, "person") with 寸 (cùn, "hand") depicts a person performing a hand action, yielding meanings like handing over or giving, which extend to paying. Some analyses instead take 又 (yòu, "hand") as the right-hand component in early forms, but the standard composition is 亻 + 寸.
