## just now
---
- **traditional:**: 剛
- **simplified:**: 刚
- **pronunciation:**: gāng
- **definition:**: just now
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 刚(剛)刚(剛) (gānggāng, "just now")
  - 刚(剛)才 (gāngcái, "a moment ago")
  - 刚(剛)好 (gānghǎo, "just right")
- **etymology (剛):**
  - **type:**: phono-semantic compound
  - **description:**: phono-semantic: phonetic: 冈(岡) (gāng, "ridge") + semantic: 刂 (dāo, "knife").
  - **interpretation:**: 冈(岡) provides the pronunciation gāng, while 刂 indicates the semantic domain of cutting/hardness, fitting the original sense "hard/strong". The modern adverbial senses like "just now", "exactly", and "barely" developed later as extensions to precision or immediacy.
  - **component characters:**
    - 冈(岡) (gāng, "ridge")
    - 刂 (dāo, "knife")
  - **reference:**: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%89%9B
  - **simplification rule (刚):**: Simplified from 剛 by replacing the phonetic component 岡 with its simplified form 冈 while retaining the right-side knife component 刂, reducing strokes.
