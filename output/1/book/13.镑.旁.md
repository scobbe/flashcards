  - **interpretation:**: The character combines a top element interpreted as 辛 (xīn, "punishment") as the semantic indicator with 方 (fāng, "direction") providing the pronunciation páng. The semantic top has varied historically (e.g., forms like 用 (yòng, "use") or 凡 (fán, "ordinary")), but it likely suggested marking or separation at the periphery, which later generalized to the sense “side/beside.”
