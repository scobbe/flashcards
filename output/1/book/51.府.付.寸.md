  - **description:**: ideogram: 手 (shǒu, "hand") → add 丶 (zhǔ, "mark") at the wrist to indicate the pulse/measurement point.
  - **interpretation:**: It shows a hand with a dot marking the wrist pulse point, hence a small segment used for measuring. Shuowen explains it as the spot where the radial artery is palpated, and the unit sense derives from the distance from the wrist to that point. Some analyses also treat the unit sense as a phonetic loan from 尊 (zūn, "honor; esteem").
