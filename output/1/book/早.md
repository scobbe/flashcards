---
- **traditional:**: 早
- **simplified:**: 早
- **definition:**: early in the day
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 今早 (jīnzǎo, "this morning")
  - 明早 (míngzǎo, "tomorrow morning")

- **etymology (早):**
  - **type:**: pictogram → phono-semantic compound → ideogrammic compound
  - **description:**: pictogram of 早 (zǎo, "acorn") → phono-semantic: semantic: 日 (rì, "sun"), phonetic: 棗 (zǎo, "jujube") → ideogrammic: 日 (rì, "sun") + 甲 (jiǎ, "first")
  - **interpretation:**: It began as a drawing of an acorn, later borrowed for the ‘morning’ word. Meaning was shown with 日 (rì, "sun") and the sound by 棗 (zǎo, "jujube"); it was then reinterpreted as 日 (rì, "sun") + 甲 (jiǎ, "first")—the sun first rises.
