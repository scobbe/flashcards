## early; in advance
---
- **Character:** 早
- **Pronunciation:** zǎo
- **Definition:** early; in advance
- **Contemporary usage:**

- **Etymology (早):**
  - **Type:** pictogram → phono-semantic compound → ideogrammic compound
  - **Description:** Early bronze: pictogram ‘acorn’, original form of 皂 via 皁 (also once written as 草), borrowed phonetically for “morning”; late bronze: 日 “sun” + phonetic 棗 (sometimes simplified as 朿); small seal: 日 + 甲 “first” (Xu Shen), with 蚤 also used in some ancient texts.
  - **Interpretation:** The original acorn pictogram (the source of 皂) was repurposed for the sound value to write the ‘morning/early’ word; adding the semantic 日 ‘sun’ with the phonetic 棗 tied the graph’s sound (OC *ʔsuːʔ) to the same phonetic family, which develops to Mandarin zǎo. The later small‑seal analysis 日 + 甲 ‘first’ transparently depicts the sun’s first appearance, reinforcing the modern sense ‘early’.
