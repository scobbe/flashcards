- **Etymology (MISSING):**
  - **Type:** pictogram → phono‑semantic → ideogrammic
  - **Description:** pictogram of acorn → semantic: 日 (rì, sun), phonetic: 棗 (zǎo, jujube) → ideogrammic: 日 (rì, sun) + 甲 (jiǎ, first)
  - **Interpretation:** It began as a drawing of an acorn, whose sound was later borrowed to write “morning,” and the form was clarified by adding 日 (rì, sun) for meaning with 棗 (zǎo, jujube) for sound. Later scholars reinterpreted it as 日 (rì, sun) + 甲 (jiǎ, first) to picture the first light of day.
