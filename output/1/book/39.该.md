  - **type:**: phono-semantic compound
  - **description:**: phono-semantic: semantic 讠(言) (yán, "speech") + phonetic 亥 (hài, "earthly branch").
  - **interpretation:**: The character combines 讠(言) as the semantic determinative to indicate meanings related to speech or statements, with 亥 as the phonetic element approximating the sound gāi. The semantic side suits its modern uses in discourse, such as marking what is said (the aforementioned) and expressing deontic modality (should/ought) in statements.

    - 讠(言) (yán, "speech")
    - 言 (yán, "speech")
    - 亥 (hài, "earthly branch")

  - **simplification rule (该):**: Simplified by replacing 訁 with the abbreviated speech radical 讠 while keeping the phonetic component 亥 unchanged.
