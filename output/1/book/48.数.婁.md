- **traditional:**: 婁
- **simplified:**: 婁
- **pronunciation:**: lóu / lǘ / lǚ
- **definition:**: # sub-component
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 娄(婁)子 (lóu zi, "a mess")
  - 捅娄(婁)子 (tǒng lóu zi, "stir up trouble")
  - 娄(婁)罗(羅) (lóu luó, "minor underling")
- **etymology (婁):**
  - **type:**: phono-semantic compound → ideogrammic compound
  - **description:**: phono-semantic: semantic 爪 (zhǎo, "hands") + phonetic 角 (jiǎo, "horn") + semantic 女 (nǚ, "woman") → ideogrammic: 母 (mǔ, "mother") + 中 (zhōng, "middle") + 女 (nǚ, "daughter").
  - **interpretation:**: Originally a phono-semantic graph with 女 and 爪 providing general human/female semantics and 角 giving the sound, while the precise original meaning is noted as uncertain. It was later reinterpreted ideogrammically as 母 + 中 + 女, a folk analysis emphasizing kinship imagery. The semantic parts classify the character’s domain, but the reading carried over into modern uses.
