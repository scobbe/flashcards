- **traditional:**: 常
- **simplified:**: 常
- **pronunciation:**: cháng
- **definition:**: often; common
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 常人 (cháng rén, "common people")
  - 常驻(駐) (cháng zhù, "permanently stationed")
  - 常常 (cháng cháng, "very often")
- **etymology (常):**
  - **type:**: phono-semantic compound
  - **description:**: phonetic: 尚 (shàng, "still") + semantic: 巾 (jīn, "cloth").
  - **interpretation:**: Formed with 巾 (cloth) as the semantic determinative and 尚 as the phonetic, originally denoting a lower garment. The graph was later borrowed for the homophonous sense ‘long-lasting; frequent’, and the original garment sense was written separately as 裳. The semantic element matches the older clothing-related meaning, while the modern adverbial sense persists via phonetic borrowing.
