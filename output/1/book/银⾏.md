## silver
### subword in "bank; financial institution"
---
- **Character:** 银 (銀)
- **Pronunciation:** yín
- **Definition:** silver; the metal (element Ag).
- **Contemporary usage:**
None
- **Etymology (銀):**
  - **Type:** phono-semantic compound
  - **Description:** semantic 金 (“metal”) + phonetic 艮 (OC *kɯːns).
  - **Interpretation:** The metal radical 金 flags a meaning related to metals, naturally fitting ‘silver’. The phonetic 艮 contributed the sound value, with Old Chinese *ŋrɯn reflected in Middle Chinese ngin and yielding modern Mandarin yín. The separate note “From Proto‑Sino‑Tibetan *d‑ŋurl” with Tibetan དངུལ (dngul) and Burmese ငွေ (ngwe) shows the word is an inherited ‘silver’ term across Sino‑Tibetan, reinforcing both the metallic sense and continuity of the reading.

## OK; all right; to work
### subword in "bank; financial institution"
---
- **Character:** ⾏ (MISSING)
- **Pronunciation:** xíng
- **Definition:** Used colloquially to mean “OK; fine; this works.”
- **Contemporary usage:**
  - 行，就这么定了。 (Xíng jiù zhème dìng le) - OK, it's a deal.
  - 我觉得这方法行。 (Wǒ juéde zhè fāngfǎ xíng) - I think this will work.
- **Etymology (MISSING):**
  - **Type:** Pictogram; possible loanword
  - **Description:** Pictogram—street intersection; later analyzable as 彳 + 亍 though not originally a compound. Schuessler (2007) tentatively: borrowed from Mon‑Khmer (cf. Khmer រង ‘ridge, gutter’); also cf. Burmese ကျင့် ‘to practice’.
  - **Interpretation:** A crossroads pictogram naturally evokes movement and traffic, which motivates core senses like ‘to walk/go’ and, by extension, ‘to carry out; to work; be OK’. Later folk analysis into the ‘step’ radical 彳 plus 亍 reinforced motion/execution semantics. Membership in the same phonetic series (OC *ɡraŋ) helps explain modern readings xíng/háng tied to action and rows. The loanword hypothesis suggests an older Southeast Asian root for notions of practicing/doing, aligning with modern ‘to carry out/OK’ usage.
