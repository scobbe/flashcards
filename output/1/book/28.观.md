## to observe; view
### sub-word of "visit 'or' tour"
---
- **traditional:**: 觀
- **simplified:**: 观
- **pronunciation:**: guān
- **definition:**: to observe; view
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 观(觀)察 (guān chá, "to observe")
  - 观(觀)看 (guān kàn, "to watch")
  - 观(觀)众(眾) (guān zhòng, "an audience")
- **etymology (觀):**
  - **type:**: phono-semantic compound
  - **description:**: phonetic: 雚 (guàn, "reeds") + semantic: 见 (jiàn, "see") → simplified: 又 (yòu, "again") + 见 (jiàn, "see").
  - **interpretation:**: The traditional form is a phono-semantic compound with 見 as the semantic determinative "to see" and 雚 as the phonetic indicating the sound guān. In simplification, the complex 雚 was replaced by 又 and 見 by 见 to reduce strokes while preserving the "seeing" determinative. This fits the modern senses related to looking, viewing, and observing.
  - **component characters:**
    - 雚 (guàn, "reeds")
    - 见(見) (jiàn, "see")
    - 又 (yòu, "again")
  - **reference:**: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%A7%80
  - **simplification rule (观):**: Simplified by replacing the original phonetic 雚 with 又 and the semantic 見 with 见, reducing strokes via component substitution and graphic regularization.
