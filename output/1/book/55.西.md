## west
### sub-word
#### Xi'an City
---
- **traditional:**: 西
- **simplified:**: 西
- **pronunciation:**: xī
- **definition:**: west
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 西北风(風) (xī běi fēng, "northwest wind")
  - 西南 (xī nán, "southwest region")
  - 西瓜 (xī guā, "watermelon fruit")
- **etymology (西):**
  - **type:**: pictogram
  - **description:**: pictogram: depiction of a bag or basket → phonetic loan: 西 (xī, "west").
  - **interpretation:**: It depicts a bag or basket. The graph was later borrowed for its sound to write xī “west”, so the modern meaning is a phonetic loan rather than the original picture. An alternative view sees a bird settling into a nest to evoke the setting sun in the west; this is disputed, though Sagart (2004) supports it.
