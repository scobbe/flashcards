- **pronunciation:**: zhōng / zhòng

- **etymology (中):**
  - **type:**: pictogram → ideogram
  - **description:**: pictogram: depiction of a flagpole with a drum at the center → ideogrammic: 丨 (gǔn, "line") + 口 (kǒu, "mouth") indicating the center → semantic: 中 (zhōng, "middle").
  - **interpretation:**: It depicts a flagpole with a drum set at the central point of a field to gather people and gauge wind. Because the object marked the center, the graph came to mean "middle" and later extended to senses like "hit the center" or "attain". Alternatively, Shuowen analyzes it as 丨 (gǔn, "line") passing through 口 (kǒu, "mouth") to indicate the center.
