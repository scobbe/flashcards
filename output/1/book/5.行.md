  - **type:**: pictogram
  - **description:**: pictogram: depiction of a street intersection.
  - **interpretation:**: It depicts a street intersection. From the image of crossing roads, the sense extended to moving or proceeding, hence modern meanings like “to go” and, by extension, “OK/feasible” when something can proceed. Some later analyses parse it as 彳 (chì, “step”) plus 亍 (chù, “step”), but this is retrospective rather than original.
