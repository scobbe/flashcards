---
- **traditional:**: 數
- **simplified:**: 数
- **pronunciation:**: shù; shǔ
- **definition:**: number 'or' figure; to count 'or' enumerate
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 数(數)一数(數)二 (shǔ yī shǔ èr, "one of the best")
  - 数(數)不胜(勝)数(數) (shǔ bù shèng shǔ, "too numerous to count")
  - 数(數)目 (shù mù, "number")
- **etymology (數):**
  - **type:**: phono-semantic compound
  - **description:**: phono-semantic: phonetic: 娄(婁) (lóu, "bundle") + semantic: 攵 (pū, "tap").
  - **interpretation:**: The character combines phonetic 娄(婁) with semantic 攵 indicating an action like tapping/doing, matching the verb sense of counting and, by extension, numerical concepts. 娄(婁) supplies the approximate sound (as reflected in historical reconstructions), while 攵 marks it as an action-related graph.
  - **component characters:**
    - 娄(婁) (lóu, "bundle")
    - 婁 (lóu, "bundle")
    - 攵 (pū, "tap")
  - **reference:**: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%95%B8
  - **simplification rule (数):**: Simplified by replacing the phonetic component 婁 with its simplified form 娄 while retaining the semantic component 攵, reducing strokes and regularizing the graph.
