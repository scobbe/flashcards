- **traditional:**: 岡
- **simplified:**: 冈
- **pronunciation:**: gāng / gǎng
- **definition:**: # sub-component
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 冈(岡)比亚(亞) (gāngbǐyà, "Gambia")
  - 冈(岡)峦(巒) (gāngluán, "mountain ridges")
  - 冈(岡)陵 (gānglíng, "ridges and hills")
- **etymology (岡):**
  - **type:**: pictogram → phono-semantic compound
  - **description:**: pictogram of 网(網) (wǎng, "net") → phono-semantic: phonetic: 网(網) (wǎng, "net") + semantic: 山 (shān, "mountain").
  - **interpretation:**: Early graphs depict a net. In 岡, 网 serves as the phonetic while 山 supplies the semantic field of terrain, yielding the sense "mountain ridge"; the phonetic accounts for the modern readings gāng/gǎng. In Simplified Chinese, 冑 was not involved; rather, 冈 was adopted as the simplified form of 岡 for this meaning.
  - **component characters:**
    - 网(網) (wǎng, "net")
    - 網 (wǎng, "net")
    - 山 (shān, "mountain")
  - **reference:**: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%B2%A1
  - **simplification rule (冈):**: Simplified from 岡 by compressing the top 𦉰 component and dropping/merging the bottom 山, yielding a reduced-stroke form 冈.
