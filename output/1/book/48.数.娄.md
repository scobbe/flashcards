### sub-component of "number 'or' figure; to count 'or' enumerate"
---
- **traditional:**: 婁
- **simplified:**: 娄
- **pronunciation:**: lóu / lǘ / lǚ
- **definition:**: 
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 娄(婁)子 (lóu zi, "big trouble")
  - 捅娄(婁)子 (tǒng lóu zi, "stir up trouble")
  - 娄(婁)罗(羅) (lóu luó, "gang henchman")
- **etymology (婁):**
  - **type:**: phono-semantic compound → ideogrammic compound
  - **description:**: phono-semantic: semantic: 爪 (zhǎo, "hands") + phonetic: 角 (jiǎo, "horn") + semantic: 女 (nǚ, "woman") → ideogrammic: 母 (mǔ, "mother") + 中 (zhōng, "middle") + 女 (nǚ, "daughter").
  - **interpretation:**: Originally it combined 爪 (zhǎo, "hands") and 女 (nǚ, "woman") around the phonetic 角 (jiǎo, "horn") to write a word pronounced like lóu; the exact original meaning is uncertain. It was later reinterpreted as an ideogrammic 母 (mǔ, "mother") + 中 (zhōng, "middle") + 女 (nǚ, "daughter"), a folk analysis that did not change the reading. The modern proper-name sense for the lunar mansion and colloquial derivatives persist by convention rather than transparent composition.
  - **component characters:**
    - None, character is in atomic form
  - **reference:**: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%A9%81
  - **simplification rule (娄):**: Component replacement and stroke reduction: 婁 was simplified to 娄 by condensing the complex upper structure to 米 and retaining 女 below, reducing strokes for easier writing.
