## currency; coin
### sub-word
#### renminbi 'or' Chinese yuan
---
- **traditional:**: 幣
- **simplified:**: 币
- **pronunciation:**: bì
- **definition:**: currency; coin
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 人民币(幣) (rén mín bì, "Chinese currency")
  - 纸(紙)币(幣) (zhǐ bì, "paper money")
  - 港币(幣) (gǎng bì, "Hong Kong dollar")
- **etymology (幣):**
  - **type:**: phono-semantic compound
  - **description:**: phonetic: 敝 (bì, "worn") + semantic: 巾 (jīn, "towel") → "silk offering".
  - **interpretation:**: Combines semantic 巾 (jīn, "towel/cloth") with phonetic 敝 (bì), indicating cloth or silk offered as a gift or sacrifice. That offering sense later extended to the monetary sense of currency because silk/cloth functioned as valuables in exchange.
  - **component characters:**
    - 敝 (bì, "worn")
    - 巾 (jīn, "towel")
  - **reference:**: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%B9%A3
