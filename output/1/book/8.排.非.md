- **etymology (非):**
  - **type:**: pictogram
  - **description:**: pictogram of 翅 (chì, "wing") → semantic: 违(違) (wéi, "leave; disobey") → phonetic: 不 (bù, "not") + 惟 (wéi, "to be").
  - **interpretation:**: Depicts two wings facing opposite directions. It first meant "wings", then (per Xu Shen) extended to 违(違) (wéi, "leave; disobey"). Later it was used as a phonetic loan for the fused phrase 不 (bù, "not") + 惟 (wéi, "to be") meaning "is not", which underlies the modern negative sense and its use as a negative prefix.
