- **etymology (排):**
  - **type:**: phono-semantic compound
  - **description:**: semantic: 扌 (shǒu, "hand") + phonetic: 非 (fēi, "not") → 排.
  - **interpretation:**: 扌 serves as the semantic determinative, indicating a hand-related action of arranging or lining up, while 非 provides the phonetic cue for the reading pái. The hand semantic matches modern senses like ordering and lining up, yielding the idea of placing things in line. A comparative note in the entry links the verb to a Proto‑Tibeto‑Burman root meaning ‘to throw’, but this concerns lexical history rather than graphic formation.
