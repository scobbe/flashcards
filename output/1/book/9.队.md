## team; line
### sub-word
#### line up 'or' queue
---
- **traditional:**: 隊
- **simplified:**: 队
- **pronunciation:**: duì
- **definition:**: team; line
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 乐(樂)队(隊) (yuèduì, "band")
  - 军(軍)队(隊) (jūnduì, "army")
  - 排队(隊) (páiduì, "line up")
- **etymology (隊):**
  - **type:**: phono-semantic compound → ideogrammic compound
  - **description:**: phono-semantic: semantic 阜 (fù, "mound") + phonetic 㒸 (suì, "phonetic") → ideogrammic: 阝 (fù, "mound") + 人 (rén, "people").
  - **interpretation:**: Traditional 隊 was formed with 阜 as the semantic determinative and 㒸 as the phonetic, yielding the reading duì for a troop or team. In simplification, the complex phonetic 㒸 was replaced by 人, making an ideogrammic form 阝 + 人 that visually conveys “many people,” aligning with the modern senses ‘team’ and ‘line’.
  - **component characters:**
    - 阜 (fù, "mound")
    - 㒸 (suì, "phonetic")
    - 阝 (fù, "mound")
    - 人 (rén, "person")
  - **reference:**: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%9A%8A
  - **simplification rule (队):**: The traditional right-side phonetic 㒸 was replaced by the simpler 人, retaining the 阝 radical and reducing strokes while recasting the character as an ideogrammic form.
