  - **description:**: phono-semantic: semantic: 艹 (cǎo, "grass") + phonetic: 央 (yāng, "center").
  - **interpretation:**: The semantic determinative 艹 marks a plant-related meaning, matching the original sense ‘flower/blossom’, while 央 supplies the pronunciation. By extension, the character came to mean ‘outstanding’ for people, and in modern times it was chosen in transliterations like 英吉利 and now abbreviates Britain/English. Some scholars also propose external etymologies relating to ‘open/bright’, but the graphic structure is phono-semantic.
