- **traditional:**: 寸
- **simplified:**: 寸
- **pronunciation:**: cùn
- **definition:**: inch
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 寸土寸金 (cùn tǔ cùn jīn, "every inch is precious")
  - 寸步不离(離) (cùn bù bù lí, "always together")
  - 寸步难(難)行 (cùn bù nán xíng, "unable to move")
- **etymology (寸):**
  - **type:**: ideogram
  - **description:**: ideogram: 手 (shǒu, "hand") + 丶 (zhǔ, "dot") → mark indicating the wrist pulse position.
  - **interpretation:**: An ideographic mark on a hand indicates the wrist pulse point. The short distance from the wrist to that point was taken as a convenient measure, yielding the unit of length and later figurative senses for something very small. Some analyses also treat the unit sense as a loan use from another graph, but the wrist-pulse explanation is traditional.
