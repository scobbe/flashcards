  - **description:**: phono-semantic: phonetic: 人 (rén, "person") + semantic: 言 (yán, "speech").
  - **interpretation:**: The semantic determinative 言 (yán, "speech") situates the character in the domain of words, messages, and communication, matching senses like letter and message. 人 functions as the phonetic, giving the historical sound that developed into xìn; combined, it also evokes a person's words as reliable, underpinning the senses of trust and belief. Some sources such as Shuowen note an alternative ideogrammic analysis.
