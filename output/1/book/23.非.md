  - **type:**: pictogram
  - **description:**: pictogram: depiction of wings → semantic: 违(違) (wéi, "disobey") → phonetic loan: 'not; is not'.
  - **interpretation:**: It depicts two wings facing opposite directions. The sense extended to 违(違) (wéi, "disobey"), and was later borrowed to express general negation ('not; wrong'), aligning with its modern use as a negative marker and prefix. Some sources instead analyze it as a fusion of 不 (bù, "not") and 惟 (wéi, "to be") in oracle-bone inscriptions.
