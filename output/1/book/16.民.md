## people; citizen
---
- **traditional:** 民
- **simplified:** 民
- **pronunciation:** mín
- **definition:** people; citizen
- **contemporary usage:**
  - 国(國)民 (guó mín, "national citizens")
  - 人民 (rén mín, "the people")
  - 公民 (gōng mín, "a citizen")
- **etymology (民):**
  - **type:** phonetic loan
  - **description:** unknown original glyph → phonetic loan: 民 (mín, "people").
  - **interpretation:** The original graphic meaning is unknown. The character was later borrowed as a jiajie to write mín “people” on phonetic grounds, and this borrowed sense became standard. An alternative claim that it depicts an eye pierced by a dagger, or that it is the original form of 盲 (máng, "blind"), is rejected here due to lack of evidence and phonetic mismatch.
  - **component characters:**
  - 民
