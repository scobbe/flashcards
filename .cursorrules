# Project Rules for Cursor

- Command execution: Use Make targets for standard workflows only. One-off maintenance/debug tasks should use standalone scripts checked in under `scripts/` and run directly.
  - Examples: `make setup`, `make generate`, `make generate-debug`.
  - For ad-hoc ops (e.g., cache rebuilds, mass edits), prefer `scripts/*.py` or `scripts/*.sh` instead of adding new Make targets.

- Shell assumptions: zsh on macOS. Prefer absolute paths when passing file or directory arguments.
